A message about Big Cat Soccer:

Gentlemen,

The time has come to dust off your soccer cleats or as our international friends would say “boots," and play the beautiful game!

Big Cats last year made a historic run reaching the finals of the league. This year we are on our revenge tour, and we won’t settle for anything but the ship!

The season begins on March 18th, so it's soon to come. Registration for the team starts on February 26th at 6:00 am. By that time, there will be a Big Cats team there, which you can sign up for. The team roster fills up fast, so plan accordingly.

We will be hosting a kick-around on Sunday, March 25th at Ricci  Time TBD  for anyone interested in getting some practice in before the season starts. This will be a great opportunity, for you all, especially, if you never kicked a soccer ball or “football” before. More information will be announced soon in the GroupMe.

If you have any questions about the registration process or anything, feel free to reach out or
stop by room 401.

Roll Steds,

Shere Khan
