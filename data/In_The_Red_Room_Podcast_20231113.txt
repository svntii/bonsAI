It's been lovely. It has been lovely. We had, I saw. Old President Michael Lynch. 

Speaker 1 

Well, former, we don't call him. 

Speaker 4 

Old, still young, still young. Yeah, I actually saw him on the football game and I asked him about, I think, USC, how's life like? And he tells me that he starts going in about the working life and how hard it is. And they says. 

Speaker 6 

You're so young. He is. 

Speaker 1 

OK. Yeah, out in the wild. 

Speaker 4 

Ohh, by the way I started work on Tuesday. 

Speaker 8 

No, Sir.

So, so well, it's like 10 minute conversation about how the working world was different and it told me he'd been working for four days. 

Speaker 9 

Great.

Speaker 8 

Load. We are now going to ask. We. 

Speaker 1 

What is your favorite event of founders? 

Speaker 4 

What is my favorite event? It might be this one, but probably the rededication of the.

There you go. Another one you know we gotta rededicate. We gotta rededicate ourselves. And all of that stuff, you know, we got. To show. All of that stuff. Hey, Jack. Jack jacket. You know, we got to do that. You know, so we got to show respect and we got to play it up. You know, I don't know. I don't know if I like. I don't know if I like one day I like. I think, honestly, the best part is we're always smiling, always smiling. Why? Because this founder is always. 

Speaker 11 

All right, gentlemen.

Finally, on us may the founders smile. On you always. Well, that founder too. No, the founders fathers.

This is out harder. 

Speaker 1 

How's life off campus? 

Speaker 4 

The life on campus, let me tell you, they don't tell you how different it is, first of all. All this in here is just. Walk into their kids student center and you'll see half the senior class. 

Speaker 1 

Wow. So maybe we can charge special rent? Yeah. 

Speaker 13 

Probably that's what we could do. 

Speaker 4 

University to be making a lot of money to get into their kids. 

Speaker 15 

So do you have to drive to campus in? The mornings you walk. 

Speaker 4 

I just.

'S rolling on, everything's going now. 

Speaker 19 

I gotta ask. 

Speaker 11 

It's all about the experience. 

Speaker 9 

What do you? 

Speaker 19 

Think about our Notre Dame football chances. I hear that our bowl game could be the pop tarts. Listen, I love a pop tart myself, but here's my. My stance on this, OK, yeah. If we're not going new year. Six can we get like Hawaii Bowl or like Bahama Bowl? 

Speaker 11 

I agree. 

Speaker 9 

Like, give us something like that. 

Speaker 1 

Thank you. Thank you. I'm. I'm all for that. I mean, rifle in Detroit. No. Who wants that? I agree. 

Speaker 10 

Yeah, no one wants no. 

Speaker 9 

No, it's great for me because. 

Speaker 19 

I can go. 

Speaker 1 

Hawaii send us off. 

Speaker 19 

I'll take the Gator Bowl again if it means like Florida. 

Speaker 17 

Yeah. 

Speaker 8 

Palpable. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, I I don't know. How do you say like, oh, we're going to pop target. OK like. Congratulations. Like, how do you keep? A straight face. And how do you like, say, your dignity? You know, even just. 

Speaker 19 

You're gonna hang up a pop tart bowl championship like Banner. 

Speaker 1 

Just the merchandiser has like ohh you went. 

Speaker 10 

To the pub table and. 

Speaker 1 

When will this be enough? This mid-december, like December 5th, something. OK. Well, maybe I you know, if we go to the pop tart bowls, I think that we're. Going to be having a pop tart bar. 

Speaker 20 

Oh yes. 

Speaker 1 

Don't tell anyone and. Hush. Folks, if you're listening, don't tell your sons. Pop tarts all around. 

Speaker 18 

Yeah. 

Speaker 6 

We'll go to Costco and get. 

Speaker 1 

The family pack, just what I thought we. Could have won? Yeah. Who? Yeah. 

Speaker 11 

The good news is. 

Speaker 1 

We're always winning instead, so we. Are winning instead always? This is a hall of winners. We're winners. Now I got. To ask. Would you go to the pop? 

Speaker 19 

Tart ball, where is the pop purple I. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. Where is the postcard? I think it's Orlando. Is it? Ohh. And actually you're right. It isn't. 

Speaker 14 

Don't even know. 

Speaker 19 

I'm the child of Disney adults, so I'll. Probably be there. Anyway, but yeah, just drop. I don't. 

Speaker 8 

Ohh I. Dropped it. 

Speaker 1 

Got a little cigar mishap. There, but I don't even think I would go to the pop. Tart bowl to be honest with you all. Used to. 

Speaker 19 

I kind of want the T-shirt. It's a little. 

Speaker 17 

Oh, it is like. 

Speaker 19 

Have Notre Dame pop tampions. 

Speaker 1 

Oh yeah, that's gonna be a hot I'd buy one. Oh yeah, the books are my sell out. Living fast. You know, it is a hot T-shirt, though. The Founders week shirt. Ohh I I've been seeing it all week and too hot to handle and that's. 

Speaker 8 

Of the what? 

Speaker 20 

It's it is too. 

Speaker 8 

That it's literally hot. 

Speaker 1 

Hard to handle. Yeah, it's, you know, and and folks, if you don't. Know it's actually a retro. Line taken from the 80s after the hall burnt down to the 4th floor burned down. They said we will rise from our ashes. We will rise again as it's Phoenix coming out of the. Ashes and it's. It is hot, it is hot, too hot to handle.

Speaker 1 

Miss West. Well, you know you. You you did get the lottery. You hit the lottery. Jackpot. That's right. That's right. Now, did you also take advantage because we are having a campaign. I don't know. If we didn't totally talk about this at EDC. 

Speaker 5 

Yeah, for real. 

Speaker 1 

You jackpot. You know, we're we're having nugs chicken Nuggets because unfortunately we're looking too much money on them because everyone insists that everything be $2.00. So we just couldn't. The margins just weren't there since. We brought him back just for this weekend as a part of our NUGS not drugs campaign. Yeah, it is. 

Speaker 5 

It's all a campaign. 

Speaker 1 

A solid campaign. 

Speaker 5

So. 

Speaker 1 

Away. Ohh right. Well, let me ask, what do you think is our? Chances of beating Wake Forest. 

Speaker 5 

Wake Forest. So it's it's a Sam Hartman revenge. So we know that he's going to show out. 

Speaker 20 

Yes. 

Speaker 5 

A little if you. Call the backside and it's like, OK, game against who was it again on Clemson, you know, USC, although we had a dominant offensive performance, it was like he was aided a lot by the defense. 

Speaker 1 

Exactly. 

Speaker 5 

But you know, I think this is the time where he stands up. He shows, you know, I came to Notre Dame for a reason. I don't need you anymore. Wake Forest. So I think he's going to show out, you know. 

Speaker 8 

Oh. 

Speaker 5 

Get get 2. 3-4 touchdowns, maybe a rushing touchdown? Just. 

Speaker 10 

Ohh wow. 

Speaker 5 

Just to put it in the. But I like. I like his chances. I think. I think there's going to be a lot of push-ups from this fan. Yeah. Yeah, I guess so. 

Speaker 1 

So no nerves. 

Speaker 20 

A lot of push-ups, so. 

Speaker 1 

I'll get that arm workouts going early. That's you know, I'm always a little bit nervous.

As a fan, no, it's it's next weekend. But. 

Speaker 5 

Is it raining this weekend? Next week?

Speaker 9 

What? What's your opinion? 

Speaker 1 

On the capes that. 

Speaker 20 

They have. Ohh I mean. It looks like they're trying to cosplay. 

Speaker 1 

Well, you know, you don't always say give them more distractions. To take away how bad they are, put glitter on them. Smoke show. 

Speaker 20 

Exactly. It's distracting thing to stop. 

Speaker 11 

Special effects of life alert. 

Speaker 20 

Were out there. 

Speaker 1 

OK, now what about the other band? We hadn't had another. What was the other one? Wake up pit pit there. No, no. They knew they couldn't tell the difference. Just really disappointed.
