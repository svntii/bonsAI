Ryan - International Women’s Day
We'll be tabling in Duncan to raise awareness for International Women's Day -- painting nails purple, putting on temporary tattoos, and handing out "We Should All Be Feminist Books" for $1 each -- proceeds going to the Girl Scouts of Central Indiana. Our goal is that all of the men in HPC will come get their nails painted to show their support!
