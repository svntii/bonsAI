Gentlemen,

Hey, ever thought about...
1. visiting our nation's 51st state? 

2. experiencing the wind in the windiest city?

3. or just taking a relaxing weekend where America goes to play?

If so, now would be the time to visit Canada, Chicago, or Toledo, Ohio. Yes, Toledo, Ohio....America's playground.
It’s Junior Parent Weekend. No parties or social gatherings this weekend as this special weekend commences.
So, NOW would be a great time to get away and take advantage of...

 1. the slots machines of Windsor in Ontario, Canada.

 2. among other things, the winter wind of Chicago.

 3. all that Northwest Ohio has to offer.

Thanks for your attention... and all my ❤,

 St.  Ed
