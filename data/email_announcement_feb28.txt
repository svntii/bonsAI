Gentlemen,

Have you ever played 2k in the park with your friends, wearing the most outrageous outfits, and say to yourself, "Man, I wish I could do that?" Well do I have news for you!

The famed bookstore basketball tournament is back and better than ever. There are a few things to keep in mind when registering:
- This year, there are three tournaments - men's, women's, and co-rec.
- The Co-rec tourney follows Rec Sports intramural rules  at least 2 men and 2 women on each team
- You can have more than 5 members on a team but starting round of 32, substitutions are prohibited. You must finish the game with the five you started with. Starting round of 32, you also cannot be on multiple teams. 
- There is a $40 registration fee due when you register on IMLeagues but every registrant will get a Legends coupon. The more you win, the more you earn.
- This year, a costume contest is in the works as well as Rockne Cup Points.

Grab 5 or more of the best guys you know, dress up in your silliest, most outrageous costumes  teams should have a theme , and show everyone why Steds is the best hall on campus!

Register here by March 17th at 11:30 p.m.
