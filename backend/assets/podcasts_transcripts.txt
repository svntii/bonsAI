Transcript 

Speaker 1 

I'm Father Ralph, and you're in the red room tonight. We're going to hear from former president Aidan Tompkins, studs junior and former Hall president. Later, we'll hear from President Daniel Young and Vice President Aiden Reznor, student body government and. 

Speaker 2 

And we'll have good news and weather with Nicolai. All this is happening now in the red room. Nikolai, welcome. Here we are. Oh, my gosh. We are coming off a jam packed weekend. 

Speaker 1 

We are we. Are I have to I have to stop? You right now. 

Speaker 2 

How is Junior parent weekend? It was literally I couldn't have dreamed of something better. It was phenomenal really. It won't blindness the weather. My poor parents have never been so cold. They were like. I don't even want to look at the campus. Let's just stay in stands and be warm. But they powered through. And it was phenomenal. The president's dinner was, you know, Father Jenkins went all out. He really nailed it. And he did. He were you? I saw you at the mass too. 

Speaker 1 

And I did. You know, usually that's the extent. Of my participation. 

Speaker 3 

Yes. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, I I never go to the dinner. How? Was the dinner. 

Speaker 2 

The dinner was so we the it's tables of eight. We did not. It was nine. Yeah. It's when I'm at tables of nine. When I was thinking of moms weekend tables. 10. Yeah, we've upgraded I for moms weekend. Yes, but either way. Well, I'm too old for two. And the dinner was phenomenal. 

Speaker 1 

Wait, I thought this tables are. I think they're tables of 10s. 

Speaker 2 

And we had. Tables of nine and we did not. Book our table fast enough so we were in the back third, which actually was like. Pretty sharp because you. Had the back screen so it was like you were on the front and the performance so they had a couple of speakers from the class of 2025. Those were not so hot, but when Father Jenkins came up, he said he left his best speech for last for his 19th junior parents weekend and he left it all out there. Left it. All on the floor. Oh, wow. It was. It was like, so he did it where it was a slideshow from when he was a kid at junior parents weekend. When he was a junior to now, as his final departing year as a president. So wow. This took us through the timeline. And it was phenomenal, pretty witty. Pretty witty, you know you. Got 15 minutes of Father Jenkins. Best and brightest wisdom. 

Speaker 1 

Well, how about the dinner? Was it rubber chicken well? 

Speaker 2 

So we get that. The lovely rubber chicken that just goes. 

Speaker 1 

It's but it's. 

Speaker 2 

Down so well. 

Speaker 1 

But it's Amish. Made. Is it really? I I don't know it. 

Speaker 2 

Now. It tasted Amish made and. They had incredible Brussels sprouts. Ohh, it was phenomenal. 

Speaker 1 

How is the line for the glass of wine? 

Speaker 2 

There was so there. Was no bar whatsoever. No wine, nothing. Primer. 

Speaker 1 

Water. Ohh, that's ridiculous. You know that's that'd be like, you know, going over for someone's house for dinner and then having no bread. I it's unbelievable. I guess they thought that I I don't know what they thought. I mean, they just dropped the ball. They just just. 

Speaker 2 

On that one. Wow. So I wouldn't have to wait in the line, but there was nothing else. To really wait. 

Speaker 1 

For. Oh, that's sad. Well, you know, I guess we did find the one great cloud. 

Speaker 2 

Well, you know another great club if you depend on how you look at it, great Club, but they had. The class rings that were for. Sale. So they had a discount, a mighty $150.00 discount on those class rings. Then that doesn't really do much. It's not much of A dent on those suckers. So this like there's like 6-5 sizes. Obviously for men, there's two realistic sizes. And the starting places like $1600 so. 

Speaker 1 

Wow. 

Speaker 2 

A little chunk of. 

Speaker 1 

Change. Now go start selling some plasma. 

Speaker 3 

Ohh, I'd better get out there fast. 

Speaker 

Oh my. 

Speaker 2 

Maybe I'll sell my hair for mullets weekend heat. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, yeah, you could. You could sell it here. Now. Did you like these steads reception? We had a. 

Speaker 2 

Little bit of an accoutrement out there. With some cookies and. 

Speaker 4 

I think that was about a cups. 

Speaker 1 

Of coffee cups for coffee. Yes. Yeah, I. Mean we all know that stents doesn't really do a big thing for junior parent. We save it all up, we save it all for moms weekend and but yet we still acknowledged everyone's presence. We had a tray of cookies from Martins. We had oatmeal Raisin and chocolate chip, and you could have coffee at the coffee machine. Yeah. So my my dad actually was like, what is this doing here? This was he. He was a shot. We had a machine like this. 

Speaker 2 

He has all of us. Work. So he was like, I haven't been. Shocked. So you know what we're doing? Something, right. Well. 

Speaker 1 

You know, we gotta say thank you, Chris Scott. Thank you so much for making that possible. 

Speaker 2 

Working with something right out here. 

Speaker 1 

Good friend and Chris Scott and you know we put all the different creamers and there's one Creamer that's brand new that was not there but is near now Italian sweet cream. 

Speaker 

Oh. 

Speaker 2 

Wow. Interesting. No, I remember I told I'm a tea man myself. 

Speaker 1 

Now, are you a coffee guy? Well, you should try it. Try it. Just give. 

Speaker 2 

I mean. 

Speaker 1 

You go here the old college go. 

Speaker 2 

Give it a. Go, you know like. Give it the old college girl. That's beautiful. 

Speaker 1 

Well, you know, and that sounds like a lot like our basketball team. How was it met? How was the men's basketball team? 

Speaker 2 

Oh my God. They're not just giving it a college go, they are really, really working out there. Three wins in a row. And I'm surprised to say the least, but they are no longer last in the ACC, which that's a huge they're I think they're 13th now in the ACC. So give them a rice round of applause. They've won their last three games. They just won against Louisville. Candidly by 22 points. So I mean that's that's like. 

Speaker 1 

Wow, take that, Louisville. 

Speaker 2 

So it's really been a lot of fun out there. 

Speaker 1 

OK. And I at the same time, our states hockey team. 

Speaker 2 

Ohh my gosh, they just keep there they are. 

Speaker 1 

They're in the finals. I roll. Yeah, they're, you know, it's fire and ice, folks. 

Speaker 2 

Fire on ice. 

Speaker 1 

Not the ice Capades here. You know it's ice follies. It's it's fire and ice. Those guys are on in Fuego, and then it's Spanish for on fire. Yes. 

Speaker 2 

In flight, no, I mean. Oh, I didn't know that, but no, they have been super easy though, and they're a little bit of Spanish there. But. And honestly, all stud. Sports have just been on A roll. I I. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Athletics are good, dorm culture is great. Presidents out, I mean, student body presidents. 

Speaker 1 

Are and the sun is shining. I mean, what can you ask for anything more? Well, you know, the one thing I'm really worried about. You know, when everything is going right, then all of a. 

Speaker 2 

What are we not doing? 

Speaker 1 

Sudden doom and. Disaster happened, folks. We are on a time bomb and I'm not talking about anything financially. 

Speaker 2 

Uh. 

Speaker 4 

It's. 

Speaker 1 

I'm talking about the swift Kelsey relationship. 

Speaker 2 

Ohh. 

Speaker 1 

Folks, we are on thin ice because you know what people are now realizing this is all a. 

Speaker 2 

Sham. Really. So I I haven't been. Keeping up, I've been reading my daily. Mail every morning. 

Speaker 1 

Well, the well, they clearly that was in the Daily Mail, it confirmed. My suspicions all along, which is this, is a relationship of convenience that both of them got something out of and, you know, maybe they might have found love, you know, in the process. But it's not going to sustain it because it was never built. 

Speaker 2 

In the. 

Speaker 1 

Upon it, you. Don't say no. And so now. Now all the prognosticators are saying. 

Speaker 2 

Hey. 

Speaker 1 

That the breakup is imminent. Really imminent relationship. Yes. Breakup. So I think we're just going to stand by and wait for a little more there, but. 

Speaker 

Ohh. 

Speaker 1 

It it's it's on the horizon. Ohh boy yeah. But you know what else is? 

Speaker 2 

On the horizon, what's on the horizon? 

Speaker 1 

More great food at EDC cause you know what they got Shamrock shakes again. It's that time of the year for limited time only. Yes, yes, we got mint chocolate chip. And they're serving up, you know, with real milk. Take that, McDonald's. 

Speaker 2 

Ohh. 

Speaker 

Just. 

Speaker 2 

Oh my God. Shamrock. What can't we do? And inflation hasn't touched that either. It's just the gift that keeps on giving. 

Speaker 1 

No. Yes, inflation has not touched that at all. No. And once again, you can get that again, all that good. Is for two. Wow $2.00 a handcrafted. Shake. Hand I mean, this is handcrafted. This isn't just coming out of a box. Like it could have been hand turned. Well, you know, I don't know, but we'll have to ask the ice cream makers. I'm not sure about that, but that that is going on. There's gonna be some other things coming. Out. For the spring, but we we. It was so popular that we had a run on shakes. I had to go out and buy 4 gallons of. More ice cream. Because the demand is just there through the roof. 

Speaker 

It's the. 

Speaker 1 

It is through. The roof. 

Speaker 5 

How did it? 

Speaker 2 

How did it start the Shamrock shake? 

Speaker 1 

Well, you know, what do you think of when you think of March, you think of spring, you think of green, you think of Saint Patrick's Day Shamrocks? Shamrock shakes. Boom. You know, Christmas time, peppermint shakes, but unfortunately, we couldn't do this here because we couldn't find any peppermint. Ice cream. 

Speaker 2 

Ohh I remember. 

Speaker 1 

That yeah, it was a drought. I mean, folks. If you don't, I don't know, I. Don't know if there was some supply chain problem there or you. Know COVID no Suez. Sue has canal entry. You know, I don't know, but I don't know. You know, we need our peppermint ice cream instead, and we just weren't able to deliver. But folks, don't worry. We still delivered smiles, because that's what, Ed. Does everything with a smile and you know what else? Oh, we, we are going to be, I think, and I and and maybe I can let this out of the out of the bag out of the bag. We are going to be serving up something really special and I think I can talk about it. Note. Even though Isaiah the manager's not here. 

Speaker 2 

Cat out of the. Early. 

Speaker 

Ohh. 

Speaker 1 

We're going to be. Green spring rolls. 

Speaker 2 

Get out. Yeah. Really. And like, how are we making these spring? I. 

Speaker 

Spring roll. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Mean this? Yeah, well. 

Speaker 1 

How are we making them? Well, you know, the fun thing is, I think they're going to be pre made and we're just going to, you know, serve them up. You know, they're going to be made in a in a I think the edx. Oven. But we're just going to get them like at Costco or GFS wherever and then what we going to do is we're going to pass the savings on to all of our customers. So you know, so that's going to be great. Yes, but you. 

Speaker 2 

That's awesome. Know what else is great? What is great. 

Speaker 1 

This show I think we got. To get it going all we. 

Speaker 

Right. 

Speaker 2 

Sure, do not. Not. That's for us. 

Speaker 1 

For now, let's get. 

Speaker 2 

It on, let's get it on. Get it? 

Speaker 1 

All right, Nikolai, our first guest tonight is none other than our hall, former hall president Aiden Tompkins. Aiden. Mr. President. Welcome. 

Speaker 2 

The man himself thank. 

Speaker 5 

You for having me? It's great to. 

Speaker 1 

Be here. Is. 

Speaker 3 

It. 

Speaker 1 

Well, it's always good to see you, Mr. President. I'm pointing myself a cup. Of tea here. You know, just a. Little a little. Pick me up here, you. Know I'm getting a little old a. Little tired by all the rhythms low. But you know, you may have had. You had some. She was too. Did she have dysfunctional, somewhat dissociated disassociation or dissociation? What? 

Speaker 5 

Yeah. Yeah. So I was learning about this one of my classes. There's something called Phantom Limb syndrome is when somebody who's missing one of their limbs, they still can, like, feel it and get paid. 

Speaker 1 

Wait, wait, wait, wait. But I'm looking at you. You got two arms. You got two legs. You're not missing any limbs. 

Speaker 5 

Well, Father, I'm talking about Phantom bullet syndrome. Yeah. Yeah. After after our battle with malaria, I got my bullet shot. I got a bullet and then later got it chopped. Cause, you know, interviews and whatnot, I think I was a little too intimidating for my classmates. They weren't speaking up as much. The discussions really falling well. 

Speaker 1 

Oh. Oh, wow, folks. Wow. I see. 

Speaker 5 

So I got it chopped, but I kept finding myself going to fix the back of my hair only for my hands to keep. 

Speaker 

Ohh. 

Speaker 5 

Moving through nothing. 

Speaker 

Ohh way. 

Speaker 2 

No. Yeah. Ohh no. 

Speaker 1 

So people are like looking at you like, wow, he's crazy. Yeah. So. Well, did anyone, like, did you ever see anyone notice that, like someone in Duncan Student Center saw you at Chick-fil-A Line? Do that. 

Speaker 5 

More than usual, yeah. Or not that I I think is one of those things that would happen and I would be so embarrassed. Just put my head down so I couldn't. I couldn't even see if anybody saw it. 

Speaker 1 

People quickly looked away. 

Speaker 5 

Yeah, exactly, exactly. 

Speaker 2 

At this. 

Speaker 1 

Sorry, no, look into the ceiling. Yeah, OK. Well, so did you. Ever have that, Nicholas? 

Speaker 2 

You know, this year was tough on me. I did not get them all. This year at all so. 

Speaker 1 

I know, but in the. Past. Well, that's the. 

Speaker 2 

Difference was like instead of not having that phantom issue, it's like seeing everyone else. I was on the other side or I was the one jealous. It was more of a like, envy, envy, jealousy, disappointment in my own. 

Speaker 1 

Oh. Yes. 

Speaker 2 

Self self esteem. 

Speaker 5 

Allow all valid responses. To get forward promotes against malaria. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. Wow. Well, you know, you know, the Lord say don't cut. Your neighbors goods, so I guess you. 

Speaker 2 

It's very true. Those were good goods though. 

Speaker 1 

Were coming to that area, you should have. Got a mullet you wouldn't have. To you have to worry about the 10 Commandments, but no, I would say I I I don't think I had Fantom Mullet syndrome, but when I had my mullet last year, I could feel, you know, I my hair back there. It was like. Resting on my shoulders almost. And it was like a friend, you know, I cut my hair. 

Speaker 

And fences? 

Speaker 3 

I could I could. 

Speaker 1 

Feel it. Move around and you know, if you notice I'm. Growing my hair out. Yes, you know. 

Speaker 5 

Ohh yeah Ohh it's coming, it's coming this. 

Speaker 2 

Thing in the back. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, it's split in the back and but when it got chopped off, it's kind of like. I felt freer and I could run faster, but I felt like I was missing a friend. Yeah. You know someone? I was missing a wingman. And I thought like I'm. I'm going in and I don't have someone cover me in the death * trench. 

Speaker 2 

I'm home. 

Speaker 

That's. 

Speaker 2 

You know, it's like, where are you? 

Speaker 1 

So anyway, so now do you still have? Do you still feel the effects of that Phantom Mullet syndrome? 

Speaker 5 

I think it's starting to dissipate a little bit. There is something where I realize when I run, I don't feel the wind in my hair anymore, which I miss to be quite honest with you really made me feel like I was doing some. But besides that, I think it's starting to slowly go. Away, but the memory remains. 

Speaker 2 

Sure. 

Speaker 1 

So is there anything that you do that kind of like you know, unfortunately brings up the mullet memories? I mean, like, do you have like, a cup of tea? And also you have flashbacks and you walk by the Barber shop and you see a mop of hair on the floor? 

Speaker 4 

Yes. 

Speaker 5 

I I think it's whenever I see my hair brush. Because I don't use it. Until my hair gets that long, I never use it and then I'll be looking for something in my. Bathroom drawer. And then I'll have to jump. Back I'll see the brush and start getting flashbacks. 

Speaker 2 

Nice. 

Speaker 1 

I see and so. And when you get those and what? Do you do? Do you grab on to something? 

Speaker 5 

My my mouth usually begins to foam and my teammates will put a blanket over my shoulders and guide me to. The couch, so. 

Speaker 2 

It's going to be OK. 

Speaker 1 

It's gonna be. It's gonna be OK. It's gonna be OK. You know, I I I know. I just kind of, like, was resigned to the fact that I've lost a friend and just moved on. But this friend is coming back and. I can feel him coming back, you know? And it it. I didn't run my hand through my hair as much as I just shook my head, you know? And I was just, like, shaking it, you know? And I. 

Speaker 2 

He's here to stay sweet. I don't feel. 

Speaker 1 

You know, I felt like a Vidal Sassoon hair model, you know, or Paul Mason or whatever, Paul Mason or whatever. Or just wait. He makes wine. Never. Folks, that was really just tea. I'm drinking. That's really tea tea. But anyway. Well, we're glad that you got a. 

Speaker 2 

Yes. 

Speaker 1 

Bullet and you know Nikolai. 

Speaker 2 

Well, I've gotta aspire to be like the first the president, now a four year. 

Speaker 

You. 

Speaker 2 

Where? I mean, what am I not doing? With my life a lot, a lot not enough. 

Speaker 1 

Clearly now. Now, in addition to to to the mullet, you know, do you ever have? Like flashbacks to being president. Because you know, because we're we're nearing, I bring this up because you're a former home president. You you had to let go of the reins once. Yeah. You know, for President Dane Storch, who we honored and feted on Presidents Day with cherry pies. You know. You know, cherry pie is. 

Speaker 2 

Oh, the old flat. 

Speaker 5 

Classic. 

Speaker 1 

You know, synonymous with #1. George Bush, George Washington George. Just cheese. Sorry. It's the quintessential American dessert, so that's great to honor a president. But now we're coming to another hall election here in, in early March. Yeah. And you're going to go through that whole process. Is that is that gonna unearth something dislodge something that's going to both look to the top and we're going to have to, you know, rush you to to talk to some talking heads. 

Speaker 5 

I got to say I'm very excited for this upcoming election, not to say day's not doing a good job, dates, doing a great job. But I'm interested to see who's running because this is. 

Speaker 

Oh. 

Speaker 5 

Going to be the freshman class when I was President who are running for now their year. So I'm really curious to see who steps up and who thinks it's their time. I've got some names in my head if I'm honest with you. I've not shared them with anybody, OK? That's not muddy the waters. 

Speaker 

Who? 

Speaker 1 

OK, well, you know what we'll do is at the end of this broadcast, we're going to ask. You to write them down on a. I'm serious on a on a, on a post, it note. We'll keep it locked up. Yeah. Yeah. And an envelope will hermetically seal it in a mayonnaise jar and put it on the back of funk and wagnalls cart. That's an old. 

Speaker 2 

In an envelope. 

Speaker 5 

Perfect. 

Speaker 1 

Joke, folks, if you. 

Speaker 2 

Is if you know that what I'm. 

Speaker 1 

Referencing you'll you'll you'll find it funny, I hope. But we'll put those names down and we'll see how it goes. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

You know the the. The one thing I would I would say is is that you know we have a healthy, healthy love of democracy. Here the love. Yes, you know, and everyone loves that their moment in the in, in the, in the, in the town square, in the Hall square you know and hold court. But I I do want to ask what is something that you found surprising about, you know, being hall president, taking on that mantle is. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

One thing but living it out is another thing and and what's something that you think that like? Oh my gosh, I I didn't know that. You know, as Hall President, I have to be responsible for this. You know, you know, helping the wayward and recalcitrant Nicolai here, you know. Become more of a gentleman, yes. 

Speaker 5 

Yes, yes. I think the biggest surprise to me was just how much growth you're able to see from your freshman class. Year one I wasn't. I was expecting all of them to come in and be like, just graduating senior year of high school and be a little bit out of place in a college environment. But seeing them from the first day of orientation to last day class of yacht dance, totally different people. 

Speaker 1 

So you're referencing the freshman under your care. 

Speaker 5 

Yeah. The Frederick. Yeah, they I I hope. 

Speaker 1 

Under your aegis. 

Speaker 5 

That I was able to impart some wisdom. Onto them like I. Remember, one of the first days. Of orientation one of the kids. Asking me, he goes. Aiden, how do I meet girls here? And I was like, you are talking. To the wrong guy. But they're just like styles of questions like that versus towards the end more whether it be like, oh, how do I get out of S good SBC team. Or what are? Certain clubs I should be involved in. Things like that where you. Just kind of see them. Really kind of locate and become like a real college student. It was really cool to. 

Speaker 4 

See how well? 

Speaker 2 

Wow so fast. 

Speaker 1 

Do you know Nikolai? You know what? I'm you know what I'm getting here. I'm getting the image of a mother. Bald eagle. 

Speaker 2 

I was saying a. 

Speaker 5 

Shepherd, I think my hair lights pretty good. 

Speaker 2 

You're like, yeah, no. 

Speaker 1 

You know, you know, helping the little Eaglets learn. 

Speaker 2 

How to fly and then throwing him out of the nest? Throwing him out the jacket. 

Speaker 1 

Freshman year. Then they go send some, then they're there, they go and hopefully they return, you know, and they always do. And they always do it, you know, one. They go in. 

Speaker 2 

Their flock off and. They. 

Speaker 1 

Day he's at the. Center of it all. And then the next day. He's out an off campus, living off campus and you know, a regular citizen, but always the president in our hearts. 

Speaker 5 

Just. 

Speaker 2 

Never. Not the president. No, no, no. 

Speaker 

No. 

Speaker 1 

Let me ask what is something like, you know, Linda, President of the United States Lee's office. Supposedly. They always write a letter for the incoming president. 

Speaker 2 

What would you? 

Speaker 1 

What would you say to the incoming president? You know, I don't want you to divulge what you said. To to Dean. 

Speaker 4 

Oh. 

Speaker 1 

But what would you say to this next? President coming in, what advice would you? 

Speaker 5 

Give, I would say. Be willing to listen to what your the hall believes is the best course of action, but be firm in how you stand. You don't want to be like wishy washy to start and then also one of the things that I felt I did not do a great job of was I was a little bit too firm in my. Decision where I. Would decide something and then that was kind of. How we were moving forward, which. Looking back, I think I could have been a little bit more open to input where of course I was always looking for input, but I wanted to make sure I wasn't somebody who's just getting like steam rolled over and over because, you know, sometimes you have a guy who's leading a group and. He like we can. Just do whatever we want and I want to make sure that wasn't. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 5 

The case and I. Think I may have overcorrected for that, and then the second thing is. Rely on your VP's. Definitely you should be doing like the brunt of the work. Should be doing a lot, but make sure you're utilizing your VP's cause they will be happy for it. You will be happy for it and the hall will be happy for it because whatever you. Do. Is going to be. 

Speaker 1 

Much better. You know. You know, Nikolai would have said to the answer that question. Be careful of manic Mondays. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

You know. You know, yeah, Manic Mondays, you know. 

Speaker 2 

Speaking from experience, Paris. 

Speaker 1 

I I think you know you. Guys, don't you have to? Didn't she have to go to like? Some HPC meeting. Oh yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 5 

Whole presidents counsel. That was one thing I did not rely on my vice presidents. 

Speaker 1 

Meeting. 

Speaker 5 

I felt it would be cruel to send them into just the muck of bureaucracy every time, every week we have to go to all Presidents Council meetings. We do roll call, which was a big chunk of the meeting. I felt we could streamlined it a lot then we. Here all the halls complain about what was going on, whether it be funding a rector they don't. Care for us? 

Speaker 2 

Thank you. 

Speaker 1 

You know, I felt that I thought. It was a few effigies burned of me over. There. I saw that. All the other halls ever hated me. 

Speaker 5 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

You know, that's why I'm always so careful when I walk around. Because I'm afraid of, you know, being taken out. 

Speaker 3 

Not anymore by a scooter. No, no, no. 

Speaker 1 

So you, you. Would go over. Till the fortune stood up on the 2nd floor that whatever mezzanine level or whatever it is and you would go in there, how long would these? Meetings last for. 

Speaker 5 

The first meeting is about an hour long. The room is about 90°. They're trying to sweat us. 

Speaker 2 

Oh. 

Speaker 5 

Out I think. And towards the end of the year, they went down and looked a little bit, but they would hover around like half an hour and I thought I could have just gone in and said hello. 

Speaker 

Ohh gosh. 

Speaker 5 

I'm here and then left, but if we didn't go, I would. Have been impeached something. About doing towards the end of the year was we realize the time it would take to impeach our administration. Was beyond how many meetings were left, so I was thinking we just stopped going to the meetings because by the time SO got around having impeachment hearings because they have. Hearings for us. 

Speaker 2 

What on earth? 

Speaker 5 

Yeah. No. Oh, it is big lie. It is bureaucrat sitting over there. Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Ohh. 

Speaker 5 

I mean, it would have just been too late. We'd be like, I've already out of office. You can't. You can't impeach me out of office? Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

You can't touch me. 

Speaker 5 

And then we. 

Speaker 1 

Then we hold a special election and we vote him back. People, the people have spoken and if they said he's precluded from the. 

Speaker 2 

We should. 

Speaker 1 

Then you know what? Then you're perverting democracy. 

Speaker 2 

The people have spoken. 

Speaker 1 

The people have spoken now. Now what is one of the most outrageous claims or complaints you heard from from there, if you don't mind, I can we open up that Pandora? 

Speaker 2 

Ohh gosh. 

Speaker 5 

We were talking about flashbacks earlier this. 

Speaker 3 

Is this is? 

Speaker 4 

This is a big. 

Speaker 5 

One, it's a part of mind. I put under lock and key and threw into a river. 

Speaker 1 

OK, alright, well. I don't want to. Be I don't want to be a doctor. Reopening the wounds, but. 

Speaker 4 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

There were some pretty frivolous ones. 

Speaker 5 

Ohh yeah yeah, just ridiculous ones. And then also just crazy asks like coming people coming to us. People like oh. Do on this event, it would just be the worst event you've ever heard of. And then. 

Speaker 2 

I should have said. 

Speaker 5 

I'd say no, we don't. Want to do that event and then they take it so personally. And I'd be it guys, it's just not. Fun. I'm sorry. Like you're like, so kind about. 

Speaker 1 

It. Oh, yeah, you, you know. 

Speaker 5 

But. 

Speaker 1 

You are? Yeah, I would say I'm. Sorry, but our dance card is full. 

Speaker 4 

Yeah, there's only so much we. 

Speaker 1 

Can do we have to wait for a goldfish? So what would you say is something you don't miss? About being home President, I mean, yeah, clearly, I mean, you do miss all the supplicants coming up to you and and shaking your hand and wife and and hoping that your first child is very masculine. 

Speaker 4 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Saying all this stuff, this all of those trappings, you know, and the cherry pies? Ohh yes. But what is something you don't? 

Speaker 4 

Yeah, size, yeah. 

Speaker 

Myths. 

Speaker 5 

Ohh geez, I would say the emails I get from all the random people on campus who think Hall council is their time to speak to the hall I would get. I would get emails from you saying we have a short presentation. It's only 20 minutes long and I yeah, that's kind. 

Speaker 3 

Of all of Hall. 

Speaker 5 

Council and then they get really upset if I didn't respond to them or said no. So what I usually do is I would not respond to the first e-mail. That if they kept sending me emails, I respond saying hello. I'm just seeing this. Thank you for reaching out, but unfortunately several does not have time in our Hall Council to be able to allocate to this event. We have a jam packed schedule for the rest. Of the semester. So check that. So I tried to. I tried to be kind. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 5 

But then even then, I still get to push back sometimes, and then it's it's not happening. It's not happening. 

Speaker 

That's you. 

Speaker 2 

My hands are. 

Speaker 5 

Tied. Yeah, exactly. My hands are tied. I tied them, but they're well. 

Speaker 1 

You're under his tutelage here, Nikolai. 

Speaker 2 

And it it was very well run. You just you come in there sometimes. There was food. Most times there was. And you sit in and you just sit back and watch the show and you get all the news. 10 minutes, then the back ten. We're just chatting. And then and then it's over. It's good news and that's Friday. You know I. 

Speaker 1 

Most people might think like, you know, Nikolai, that. Whole government really is just, you know, something that kids do and make them feel. Good. And there's some. Feel good, people. 

Speaker 5 

There's a lot of that, I'll. Be honest, we want it on their. 

Speaker 4 

Resume on their resume you. 

Speaker 

Sorry. 

Speaker 1 

Know and the people. I can't stand the most are the people in the Judicial Council. 

Speaker 2 

Ohh the worst. 

Speaker 1 

One time they got on my case. That. Somehow it was my duty to submit. Candidates to them and and they needed to keep a time timeline and we got an A phone call. They called. Me up. Yeah, this is not my duty this. Is someone else? I'm I I'm. I'm like the monarch. I can't. Get into to. The democracy here, you know, and and I directed them to the person who was in charge of. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Organizing all of this, they said. But it's your responsibility, I said. It's not my responsibility. Well, don't blame me. I'm just trying to uphold the Constitution of student activities. It's like like, Oh my God. 

Speaker 2 

Are these students? 

Speaker 1 

We we have a constant. It's like holy cow, but. You know, but in all honesty, in all truth. You know, saying. Is, you know, wouldn't be. What saint's is if we didn't have, you know, people will like President Aiden taking on that mantle of leadership because. You know, there's there's no. Way we I could effectively even with the. Staff run a hall. You know and and and make it what it is. It's all of us. Working. Either, and I must admit, and I'm not trying to, you know. Give you a Gold Star. Here but, but you know he. Aiden falls in a. Long line of many Great Hall presidents, and I think something early on, that one thing I made sure that we did was always have a good working relationship and. And to get. We're working for the same thing and we can be on the same page. And we can become each other's greatest allies. And I and I don't think every rector really understands that, like somehow we're like, you know, they're that he's representing. The mob and I'm. 

Speaker 4 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Trying to, you know, you know. Law and order and Candyland over here. 

Speaker 5 

With a Rico case. 

Speaker 1 

Exactly, you know and. It's it's never that and it never will be as long as I'm here and I, you know. Folks, this is a really important job and we can never say thank you enough and give you enough kudos for all that you do. So, Mr. President, you're you are always my president. 

Speaker 5 

Ohh father relax. Relax. 

Speaker 1 

Me. I wanna McRae shirt. Aiden. Tommy. Colon my present. He's my president, you know. So, anyway, so now. Now with you out of office. 

Speaker 4 

Yeah, you know and and enjoying. 

Speaker 1 

All those perks, what do you enjoy doing these? Days long walks. 

Speaker 5 

Ohh, you know well this upcoming week. 

Speaker 1 

Ice cream after you. 

Speaker 5 

2-3 major events. 

Speaker 

Oh. 

Speaker 5 

We've got studs is in the hockey championship. 

Speaker 1 

Oh, what is that? 

Speaker 5 

Tuesday night, Tuesday night? Yeah. Tuesday night. I believe it's Tuesday night. I could be wrong. But Tuesday night against Ballmer Hall. Who for those? 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 

Oh. 

Speaker 5 

At home, who don't know. I'm living with some bomber guys. This year, so there's been a lot of. 

Speaker 2 

Uh. 

Speaker 5 

A lot of talking that has. A lot of debate about who's going to win. He's not going to. Win. Yeah. So I told them I'd be behind the stead. Which coaching? And they went oh, looks like we know where loyalty lies. And I went. Oh, yeah, that we have a secret. Yeah, exactly. What were you expecting, guys? And so, still keeping up. I said sure. With the hall. We've got a stand up show on Thursday. Which I'm excited about. It's at legends. We're back. At Legends kicked out, but we're back kicked off. 

Speaker 4 

And we're back. 

Speaker 1 

Kick alpha back. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, come with legendary comeback. 

Speaker 1 

You you can't. You can't keep, Mr. President. 

Speaker 5 

I think so, I think so. Yeah. And then beyond that, you know, just stay with my studies. And that's about it, you know. 

Speaker 1 

Well, you know, that's about all we can. Ask you to. 

Speaker 2 

Do you're doing more than? Most well, Mr. 

Speaker 1 

President. He's he's my president and he's active and he's living a life his best life. Thank you for helping us live our best life under your tutelage. Thank you, Mr. President, for coming in. Talking about your administration as well as the painful, debilitating disease of phantom Mullet syndrome. Thank you so very much. 

Speaker 5 

Thank you for having me. 

Speaker 1 

All right. Didn't you like Mr. President? 

Speaker 2 

Oh my gosh. I just feel so bad for what he's suffering through, but he has suffered of success with how great he's done. You know, maybe we should. 

Speaker 1 

Do a fundraiser for. Yes, I mean 11 cure has led into another problem and now we need. To take care of that one. 

Speaker 2 

It's crazy how? 

Speaker 1 

That works, you know, isn't it? Yeah, well, that's that. Sounds like why. We have government, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yes. 

Speaker 1 

And there's always a problem, and if we? Don't have a problem, we'll. Find one. Oh my God. Speaking of government, we got our next guest here. Our next guest. Well, believe or not, student body president and vice President President Daniel Young and Vice president in Reznor, welcome so much to the. 

Speaker 3 

Red room. Father Ralph, thanks so much for having us. It's it's a. 

Speaker 4 

Yes, always a pleasure to be here. 

Speaker 3 

Pleasure to be on the road. Ohh. 

Speaker 1 

They're just saying that they they all missing the. Wine and cheese party. As you know and and and and student government monkey mucks functionaries you. 

Speaker 2 

Yes. 

Speaker 1 

You know little, you know, a little Chardonnay pinky. Out and cheese. 

Speaker 2 

Yes. Board of trustees are waiting. Trustee shrimp. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. I I'm sure you've had trusty shrimp. It's big shrimp. It's just. 

Speaker 4 

They, you know, they say you can always. Tell the importance of the party by the. Size of the shrimp. So it's a matter that I live by. 

Speaker 1 

For sure. So you know many of times people were saying stints had a a plan going on to take over the university. And I tried to deny it, you know, hands out. You're like, no, I know. We have our. Student body president and vice president from Steads. And then John was going to go and I thought John was going to pass off the range to me carrying on that Omaha, NE. Connection. But that kind of fell through. And then? Everything fell through, but we got you. At your office. 

Speaker 3 

This this is true. 

Speaker 1 

So mission accomplished, you were elected. And now we'll almost have to say goodbye. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, Father, it's it's gone by in a blank. It really has everything. I think that we've tried to do in the past year is is bringing the spirit of Saint Eds to to the wider university. And you know, it's been tough. It's been tough, but it's it's a mission that we've we've been fighting for. 

Speaker 1 

For the last year, you know it's an effervescent spirit that, you know it's contagious. 

Speaker 2 

Felt there. 

Speaker 1 

And and you know, and it it's drawing engaging everyone and some of those people, you know, have atrophy. And I'm not gonna. I know who you are. You know who you are. And I know you at people who have. 

Speaker 2 

Atrophy. I'm calling for you. 

Speaker 1 

So I can I can understand the the the resentment, the the the reaction, the resistance, if you will and and and you know if you could speak to a little more like where did you find like headwinds that you didn't expect to see you know like you know we're we're implementing our platform here maybe I don't want to you know maybe you can talk about in general terms. We don't want you to, you know, call someone out. You're still in office. You're lame decks. We don't want you. 

Speaker 3 

Morning. 

Speaker 1 

To be lame, lame decks. 

Speaker 2 

Yes. 

Speaker 4 

Yeah. You know, I think one of the main things that we ran into were timeline discrepancies. You know, we're only in office. The year with big plans. Sometimes the university doesn't really operate on that same timeline. University has five year, 10 year 15 year 20 year plans and what I. Could maybe here to. I mean, I might have to do a fifth year, but I don't plan. On doing that 8th year, you know, I think it's tough when you bring in a big idea and the university kind of looks at it as an ongoing project to be looked into on many different levels. Whereas we would like to see actionable items kind of a lot more quickly, but we understand that there's kind of a greater, you know, lot of different factors involved in kind of the the bigger projects that we had to to. Undertake I see. 

Speaker 1 

So is that what you're saying when you realized you didn't, you know, implement your platform? 

Speaker 2 

Like a really, really good politician, you know we're. 

Speaker 4 

Able to do a lot and I think you know we accomplished a significant amount of of our platform. We're really proud of that. 

Speaker 1 

Folks, I was just joking, just joking. I I I sometimes you know, it is amazing. Like when you ask to do something here like when we want, I'll just make this up when we want to get like a chair. It takes months. I sit a sitting chair. It takes months. 

Speaker 3 

Right. 

Speaker 1 

They got to go through here and they got to get this process approved and then they got to go locally, source it and they can't locally source it. And then they got to come from, you know, the, the, the, the Suez Canal that's sacked up, you know, like. 

Speaker 2 

The red tape. 

Speaker 1 

The red shape lot of red tape. 

Speaker 3 

Lots of red. Lots of bureaucrats. 

Speaker 1 

Yes. 

Speaker 3 

But you know, we try to, we try to push through that. As best we can, but. It is tough. 

Speaker 1 

So clearly you've had to find some allies along the way that people who who rallied to your side and, you know, wanted to be your shock. 

Speaker 

MHM. 

Speaker 1 

Groups implementing your new plans and designs for for the student body who are some of those people that kind of all of a sudden jumped on the bandwagon and you maybe want to say thank you to or you're indebted to for all the stuff. 

Speaker 3 

They did? Yeah. I mean, there's definitely people who, even from the start when we were. Running our campaign, who have really been pitching in on the student side and. And chief of that is Colette Doyle. She's our chief of staff. She lives in Johnson family. So, you know, swanky, swanky hotel. But, you know, the culture doesn't compare to stats, but she's done a tremendous job. And she really is the brains behind the operation. You know, we're just, we're just the. 

Speaker 

Ohh. 

Speaker 3 

Faces and I've. Always been told I have a great face for radio. That's. No. So she's definitely first and foremost on my mind in terms of administrators. I think Father Jerry Olinger, he's the VP of of study. Affairs. He's done a tremendous job, really, has facilitated a lot of our success and I'll turn it over to Aiden if he's got some. More names but. 

Speaker 4 

I think one of the things that we. I've been really proud of over the. Course of our. Administration is that we've had really positive relationships with administrators, you know, campus dining, we're able to establish food committees. With them, the dining hall is always a subject. Debate. It always will. 

Speaker 3 

Every every. 

Speaker 1 

And you know. 

Speaker 4 

But we're able to kind of establish weekly connections with them and simple things like, hey, can you guys put coffee out all day? Like you know. And they're like, yeah, of course, we just didn't know students wanted that. So I think opening kind of channels of communication that's been wonderful. I'll also be running this if we didn't kind of thank all of our directors from our over 20 departments. And just the work that they. Done for no pay. Really. No, thanks a lot of the time. Every time, you know, there's an event that they largely plan to re facilitated. It's like, oh, thanks, Daniel for doing this event or thanks again for doing this. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. 

Speaker 4 

Event and really. 

Speaker 3 

They did the. 

Speaker 4 

Bulk of the work and I think you know, it's really been amazing to see their growth throughout the year and none of what we did would have been possible. 

Speaker 2 

This is true. 

Speaker 4 

Without the work of. Them. 

Speaker 1 

Wow. So Nicola, what I hear them saying is that they could count on the solid support of Saint Eds. Yes, that's what I'm hearing. 

Speaker 2 

You know. 

Speaker 1 

You don't have to state the obvious. That's what you should. Have said, but that's OK. Now is it? True that you are precluded from running again. Are there term limits here? 

Speaker 3 

You know, I'm going to. I'm going to go on on the air and debunk that myth. We we could have run, we could have run again, but we decided that our towns would better be served instead. So. 

Speaker 1 

You, you know, thank. 

Speaker 5 

Yes, Mr. joy. 

Speaker 1 

You we want you back. We want that talent. Thank you so very much for, you know, we could only share you. 

Speaker 2 

Of course. 

Speaker 1 

So much you know. We need you back here. We have these great ideas back. We did? Yeah. We need great ideas. You know, I, you know, I I I if I could have voted for. You guys, I. Would have voted for you, not just. Because you guys were. The stench, but. You know you are. You were fighting. For fresh Berry. 

Speaker 4 

Friday. 

Speaker 3 

You know, that's something we got. That's something we got. 

Speaker 2 

You know, FBI. This is true. 

Speaker 1 

You know that's that's my my type of thing I can get. Behind. 

Speaker 2 

Oh yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Because you know berries, you know, have all those antioxidants stops the free radicals. 

Speaker 3 

Your father. 

Speaker 1 

You can never stop too early. You never start. Start too early, is there? You know what is something that people don't know? That a student body President, Vice president, do you know I. 

Speaker 4 

Wow. 

Speaker 1 

Just make fun of you. You go into wine and cheese parties, you know, and the 16th floor of the library, you know, or the Dome or whatever it is. It's just always party, party, party, you know, sit in a meeting and shake some hands. Think that is? Well, I think that well, thank, you know and the call of the day, you know what? What's something you guys do? 

Speaker 3 

Mm-hmm. 

Speaker 1 

You know. That, Oh my gosh, I can't believe that, you know, they do that they, you know, they have to you have. To go to, I don't know. 

Speaker 2 

Stop. I'll stop. 

Speaker 4 

Yeah. I think one of the coolest things that we get to do as you know, the three of US student body President, Vice President, chief of staff is we get to talk directly to the. Board of trustees. Which is really fantastic. We get to. 

Speaker 1 

Oh, the Holy of Holies. True. 

Speaker 4 

Give a present. That's right. That's right. You know, we get to give a presentation to them, actually twice, one in the fall and one in the spring. And it's on a topic really of our own. Choice. Oh, wow. Yeah. What was? Your presentation on it. Yeah, well, glad you asked, Father. It's not a really important issue. We felt, you know, there's all a lot of talk about, you know, Notre Dame not being a competitive place. And I think that that is true. And a lot of aspects, you. You know, like I, I've heard stories that like, schools that like, you know, Berkeley or like backbone, where people are, you know, taking your notes, scribbling all over your notes like horrible, horrible stories. That doesn't really happen here at Notre Dame. But everything I think we think has a little bit of another endemic problem, it being a comparative environment, whereas. 

Speaker 3 

Oh. 

Speaker 2 

Ah. 

Speaker 4 

All the time you're looking at what is, you know, what is Andy doing? Oh, my gosh. Andy's volunteering at the hospital. I'm not volunteering at the hospital. I need to go do that to catch up to Andy. Yeah. And you know, that can be kind of damaging to the formative aspect of a student. And that was kind of what we wanted to point out to the board is. That you know, there's some ways that we can kind of mitigate that as on a university level and also on a student level, so that people when they're here, they're really focused on who am I going to be as a person as opposed to I need to fill up my resume with a million things just to compete in the job market. And it's a dangerous kind of, you know, idea that. Kind of perpetuates. 

Speaker 1 

So this is kind of like violating the 11th commandment. Thou shall not compare. That's precisely and and and and that happens. You know, all the time it will happen. It happen. 

Speaker 

Yes. 

Speaker 1 

His life, and especially in a place like this, you know where you're at a formative age where you know you want to make sure, like you're progressing. And how do you, how do you judge progression? Well, you look to someone elses. It's now a standard. And then then then that's where all of a sudden the anxiety that's where all the depression comes in. And then, you know, we kind of go sideways. But I like that a lot. 

Speaker 

Sure. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. And I think a big part of it. 

Speaker 5 

Is our worry is. 

Speaker 3 

That this this could potentially carry on past past the students time and know your name. You know you get to age 40. Ohh. Like Aiden was saying, Andy. Now Andy's got a a giant beach house. Something here, a beach, you know? Do I need a beach house, you know? And then it's this constant cycle of comparison that we're really worried about. And like you said, Father, it's a really formative. Time for our students and we have to make sure we're. Putting them on the right track. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. Wow. Well. Well, I know that you helped the the campus get on the right track and a variety of things. Is there anything that you wish you had more time to work on? To bring about some better change here. On campus and I'm and you got to. 

Speaker 2 

Leave out you got. 

Speaker 1 

To leave out the Grubhub Starship. Getting rid of those. OK, that's that's on my list. I'll take care of that one. Grubhub Starship. Is there something else? Like ohh gosh, you know. 

Speaker 2 

I had time. 

Speaker 1 

Like if we. Only had you know. 

Speaker 

One more year. 

Speaker 1 

And then, you know another time. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 4 

Yeah. I think one of the things that we ran into some unanticipated roadblocks on is we really wanted to get a like a ride service or an Uber partnership going for the campus students, whether it was they were, you know, going off campus to volunteer or didn't have a car on campus to go do those activities. And a lot of people have internships. Off campus or volunteer off campus, one of the things that we did during our term was established like a volunteer database that we put on our website, which is really cool. So like anyone can go to the student government website and find like. About 50 plus different places that accept volunteers or are looking for volunteers. But if you can't get to those places, then it's really no use. So we really wanted to find a way and you know, we didn't realize, like the liability that was going to go like we're getting involved with general counsel. 

Speaker 3 

Right, right. 

Speaker 4 

Management. Gosh, you know, and we're just driving someone somewhere. You know, we're getting these six different hoops to jump through, and I think that's one of the things that, you know, sort of when you're in this role. You need to kind of get the ball rolling and that's all you can do during your time. You need to kind of get the conversation started and then you know those that kind of has a ripple effect and they're really bringing formative change. And that's one of the things like, if we did have an extra time, I think we'd be able to really, like, hit that hard and get the ball rolling faster. And we plan to. Kind of do that as well in kind of these last few months and pass that on to our our absolutely, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

That's OK. You were right, I have magnets. Which ones are these like footballs? That you can kind of. Pass on to the next or. 

Speaker 4 

And that's the goal, right? That's absolutely the goal. 

Speaker 1 

Sorry. Gotcha. So like you know. Started the cathedral. But you'll never see it actually completed. 

Speaker 4 

Sure, sure. And that's yeah. 

Speaker 2 

It's true. 

Speaker 1 

But you know, it's continuing to be. 

Speaker 3 

Right. It's like the Sagrada Familia 200 years ago. They started it. Yeah, it's going to be complete soon, so. 

Speaker 

And. 

Speaker 1 

Yes. Well, that's so gaudy. 

Speaker 3 

You know, you know me, Father. You know me. 

Speaker 4 

That's right. Rome wasn't built in a day. And you know the the ride service also wasn't. 

Speaker 3 

Mm-hmm. Built here even. 

Speaker 1 

One last question here, I don't want. I know you have your responsibilities as. Much as must attend to. Another cheese party. Wait. It's it's a, you know, it's that it's that witching hour for cheese party that's. 

Speaker 2 

Best time of the day. 

Speaker 4 

The Chardonnay Cabernet. The Pinot flowing. 

Speaker 1 

Question is there was there? Any moment like? Oh gosh, I felt so embarrassed. You know, I like. I stuck my foot in my mouth. Or, you know, I called Father John. You know, Father Bill or some long name. Is there something like, oh gosh, I. 

Speaker 3 

Felt so embarrassed by. 

Speaker 1 

Because, you know, you know, like the President falls down, the president says, yeah. 

Speaker 

You know. 

Speaker 1 

You know it has a frigging slip or. Something else? 

Speaker 2 

Pretty and slick. 

Speaker 1 

That's a mental thing, OK? 

Speaker 3 

Exactly. 

Speaker 4 

Oh gosh, I'm trying to think. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, me too. It's a tough point, Bob. 

Speaker 1 

You know what, you probably not going to get an answer. We're going to get an answer because these. Guys are just too well polished like this thing. 

Speaker 2 

Which might be a bad thing. 

Speaker 1 

It just says we're turning out a. Great product here. That's right, the people we know it and. The people know it. Too. And they voted them in. Office and if? We could have, we would have and we would have voted you right back in. So guys, you know, we've been trying to get Nikolai these two on the podcast for over a year. 

Speaker 2 

Thank you. 

Speaker 1 

You know, once they got elected, then they'd be like, can't touch them. They became like, you know, the sacred cows. You know, I never really wine and dine, but, you know, we were they were able to make a special Karen. So we're. 

Speaker 3 

Yes. 

Speaker 

Ohh. 

Speaker 1 

Very grateful for that. So. 

Speaker 

Looking. Of course.

And yes, we are. 

Speaker 4 

Yes, we are. It's become a place where. You know, we're always out and about, it's. 

Speaker 2 

Become a place of slumber, but we. 

Speaker 4 

Want to be here during the day hours. 

Speaker 1 

As well, since my heart, my heart melts. 

Speaker 4 

This is where our. 

Speaker 2 

Allegiance lies. That's all we like to. Hear. 

Speaker 3 

No. 

Speaker 1 

Thank you so much for. Coming on. Thank you guys. 

Speaker 2 

Later on you. Oh my gosh, just. 

Speaker 1 

Amazing. You know, I, you know, and you know what? I I'm so sad that we had to share them with others, with others and and and on camp. 

Speaker 2 

It's about time we get them back. 

Speaker 1 

I know it's overdue, you know, maybe they charge campus like a fee or something like that. 

Speaker 2 

It's over the hill. Handling fears at the very least, I mean they are truly impressive, yes. 

Speaker 1 

Well, I think it's now time for some good news and weather with Nicola Nicolai. 

Speaker 2 

Oh. 'S got some good news this week. Oh, what's effort? So you know, I was strolling through the academic buildings, as one does, as a advanced junior student, and I walked into the science building. And you will not believe, no. 

Speaker 1 

What's what? Is that the new? 

Speaker 2 

Jordan Hall. 

Speaker 1 

Ohh the Jordan. 

Speaker 2 

The Nice brand new building and they have a 26 foot giraffe taxidermy giraffe has just been installed in the hallway. Wow. So this is bizarre, but you'll hear the good news in that is twofold. 

Speaker 1 

One. Wait, wait, wait. Hold up. I'm sorry. Let me just get this. I'm trying to get the imagery right. So is this a giraffe with four legs, or they've got the. So they've got. 

Speaker 2 

The two legs and. 

Speaker 5 

It's into. 

Speaker 2 

A wall, OK, so. They got two legs and it's like half the body of the **** of the giraffe. 

Speaker 1 

OK, OK, the posterior. 

Speaker 2 

The yes, the. Posterior the cookies. 

Speaker 1 

Pick up boots. Dairy, air, the dairy. So they got half a giraffe. 

Speaker 5 

Off a 20. 

Speaker 2 

6 foot giraffe. 

Speaker 1 

Sticking out of a wall sticking out of a wall? 

Speaker 5 

Stick it up. 

Speaker 2 

And it like towers over, so the whole neck like is like a crane over you. So it it's a sight to behold. Yeah. And they're doing a competition to name this giraffe to forever name whatever it could possibly be. And for a grand total prize of get this $75. 

Speaker 1 

Well, could I pay $75? Have you named it? 

Speaker 3 

You know it's. 

Speaker 2 

It's a sight to see, and it's not just one giraffe, though. They ordered 88 different taxidermied birds mammals. And I don't, and I don't even know what. 

Speaker 3 

Else but it. 

Speaker 2 

Was a whole new collection was imported in well. 

Speaker 1 

Maybe I don't know if it was something they. Bought as much. As it was stored, because I think some of these things, Father John Zahm might have shot up in the Amazon, not very serious. He went down there. Yeah, he went down the Amazon. 

Speaker 2 

Really. 

Speaker 1 

With Teddy Roosevelt and he went hunting. Wow, now everyone focuses on their falling out, and Father John Sam's getting dumped in the middle of the Amazon and having to come home because the president went on without him. But he also shot up a bunch of things and I think brought him back. So maybe these are the I'll have to do some. 

Speaker 2 

That doesn't happen every day. 

Speaker 1 

Research and and find. Ooh, how interesting. But I would say, you know, I would. You know, I I I'd like to offer a name. Ohh yes. My name would be Joffrey, Joffrey, Jeffrey or Jeffrey. Jeffrey. Jeffrey. Jeffrey Giraffe, who also used to be from Toys R Us again, I am who? 

Speaker 3 

Yes. 

Speaker 1 

Was a German. And again, I'm dating myself. It's a chain that died out before your time, and it was a toaster. All it was was a mega toy store. I mean, aisles upon aisles, aisles of toys, and it was this giraffe and everyone loved Jeffrey the giraffe. 

Speaker 2 

Oh my gosh. Jeffrey the. And he's making an appearance, Jordan, all the. Science. OK, check it out. 

Speaker 1 

Wow. Well, what would you recommend? 

Speaker 2 

I kept trying to think and I'm like what? Puns. Could I shove into this? What? Thing of being tall, I couldn't really put a. Name down. I wanted to go like spotty or something. I mean, he's got a lot of spots. Tall spots? I don't know. I'm still. Yeah. You sure went on it. You know what I would say crockpot bad. It's not done. OK, next spot. So we've also. This is the big week of the Keenan review. So it's back for its 47th year and you will not believe what time I got it online for a Thursday. OK, so there's three showings Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and there's this myth that they say all the best jokes get cut out after 30. Day I don't really believe it, but I still want it Thursday anyway. And so I got online at 1:25 PM. Tickets were distributed at 4:00, so it was a big I would say it was not worth 3 hours. Wait, but it was good. I would. It was worth a 15 minute wait. Wow. So it wasn't a bad show. Was not a bad show. It was. Worth it to? Make fun of studs. Studs did have their their every year. There's one joke about how small we are. That which. Isn't even that true anymore? I don't know what happened. Maybe 10 years ago or 20 years ago. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. No, it's the land of giants. 

Speaker 2 

It's the land. It's it's actually scary. 

Speaker 1 

And I don't like being around these guys folks, because you know why? Because I'm. Always the valley. 

Speaker 2 

So and you know, and even another point is we are so tall that risk management had to increase our railings. On the. That's true. Yeah. So, OK, whatever. Keenan. Chief Joe. We're we're moving on. 

Speaker 

And. 

Speaker 2 

So bigger and better than before and one last thing which I thought is big time is the water machines. I've reported on this before, OK. And they have finally hired and they went out of service and go local. They had to get a specialty mechanic to come in to repair these water machines to cut. And they are finally have worked for good. So it took him a good. Maybe 5 weeks. Because they kept. They we were repairing it. We're repairing it. It broke. So it's back. It's fully. And boil the water. If water might be too cold. Oh, get. Out so get. It out good problems to have life is nice and yeah, that's that. Our good news is plentiful on this campus. 

Speaker 1 

Wow. Well, you know who knew? Who knew? You know, I know we have hard water, but now we have cold hard water. Well, that's some good news. It's. That's good news. Well, how about? 

Speaker 2 

It sure is. Some weather well. The weather is also good. 

Speaker 1 

News with the weather with Nikolai Nikolai. 

Speaker 2

Speaker 2 

Also that she should have some of those. 

Speaker 1 

Highs. If only I know I didn't have the foresight, I should have. I should roll in in Mendoza. It's like the foresight class. 

Speaker 2 

You have the floor something. No, they never. So you don't want to take that class. But you know. They never tell a lie, just like George Washington and campus they.

Smooth talkers and smooth talkers with a. Vision and a heart. That's that's that says that is, you know, and they're really about the people. That's what Father Soren dreamed of.

Got say thank you to President Young and Vice President Reznor, student body government. While who knew that such a? Little Hall could do.

Transcript 

Speaker 1 

I'm Father Ralph, and you're in the red room. Well, sort of. Today, we're coming to you from St. Edwards Park, and today's guests are, well, your yacht, dance goers. That's right, folks. Yacht dance was last night. I'm here with my co-host. Stand in Nicolai Angleton and all of this is happening. Now in the red Room, sort of. 

Speaker 2 

Sort of, you know. 

Speaker 1 

Short. We can't always be in the red room, but especially on a day like this, it is gorgeous. Absolutely gorgeous. Yeah. Ohh as father Ralph. 

Speaker 3 

Said we came. 

Speaker 1 

Back from a phenomenal yacht dance once again. Your day. 

Speaker 5 

Oh, it was like we. 

Speaker 1 

Live into Chicago and it's like the world's A. Waste or we can do anything. 

Speaker 4 

You can take on the empire like you. 

Speaker 1 

Know Luke Skywalker. Oh, but it was phenomenal. We went and just went. To dinner and enjoyed. And to the. Yeah. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Let's not. Let's not speed through with the whole, you know. Well, we're going to hear perspectives we're going to we're going to, we're going to hear perspectives of other people, though. Nikolai, I'm. 

Speaker 3 

You know. Oh, I got to soak. It in. 

Speaker 2 

You know, I want. I want. 

Speaker 1 

Afraid though, we. May not get anyone. It's a very. Quiet day here, so I went to the dining hall this morning. This morning is at 1:00 AM one PM. And we had a nice three people at the studs table, so it was it was, it was. A small crowd this morning. Small. Crowd. Yes, indeed I. Think we all got back this morning. At 4:30 I got back about 4:30 and I woke up, you know, be an old man that I am at 8:30. I have to leave at. Fight it, you. Just gotta go get up and start going and. 

Speaker 6 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

I'm still tired, but it is. You can the. The sun's bringing it back. You know, it's the the the walk from. Because we parked the. 

Speaker 5 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Buses dropped off at. And that's like a good 15 minute walk. And wow, that was the last thing I wanted to do in the morning. It was, it was like a walk of shame, really. It was. It was tough. Well, I tell you, you know, there's a lot of people out here. It's a beautiful day, 65°, you know, no worries. But Stutzman walking around. 

Speaker 4 

Every hearing. 

Speaker 1 

Exactly everyone. But studs guys. So you know, it all started last night. We left. 6:00 and wheels up. Wheels up and we got out of. There quick didn't. It was fast. It was a lot. I thought like last year there was way. More waiting around. And more traffic and just. Like. Slow like bus one. I had to give it off to Joe. He kept. 

Speaker 2 

Us moving and he just. 

Speaker 4 

Read it. 

Speaker 1 

You know, we had 315 people go to the yacht dance and you know, we had. Six buses and we got people. On on the bus within probably like 10 minutes. I waited a 10 minute delay only because the bus drivers. It was. Had a powwow. Themselves and figure out what they're doing. They get Chicago. I don't blame them. Wow, it was an amazing night. Yeah, you know what it was? It was a bus full of winners. It was. That's you. Guys, all were your. Oh, we felt we felt like winners, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

We sure did. 

Speaker 1 

So where now where'd you go? You know I. I kind of gelled over this a little bit because you know it's not the sexiest location. We went to Domino's Pizza. You know, you know, to eat quickly. Time is money out there, it's. Yes, that too. And so we went to Domino's and then afterwards we we all got together as we in a hotel and just kind of enjoyed. The night got you. 

Speaker 4 

Hi. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. And then after that, we went to. The bus and then. From there, we headed off to the yard and you know, it's like I remember last year we there was like a huge line. We looked like the back of the line. Too, and I was like. Man, what's taking so long? And I finally realized this year get to the front of the line and you're like, wow, you get on the boat quick. You do, you're really. You're really. When you get to the front of line, it's like, wow, you do, you know, there's always that Pretty Little problem security, you know, the kids aren't the problem. The the problem is the security they do. And I'm. 

Speaker 4 

Ah. 

Speaker 1 

Know I wanna. 

Speaker 2 

Take it. I mean it's. 

Speaker 1 

Like, OK, I'm sure there is someone's finest, but they're not my finest. Now. Honest, you know, and we had some problems, you know, they were telling you one thing to do with people who are 21. And do something. Else with people who are not 21 and then they have you flip it all around it was it? It was just, you know, they're trying to get, you know, like, you know, 150 people to line up perfectly in the way that you want. Mr. security. Man, I'm sorry. It's just it's just not, you know, exactly. Exactly. So if we could, you know, next year I got some ideas of what we're going to do to expedite the boarding process, but it just takes some time because you they had to look. At ID's you know. Give wristbands and then there's the people who are not 21, you know. But the problem is the people of 21 have to go first. Exactly. It's like the lot. It's like, you know, they should, you know, because you know what? They're seniors, you know, they get, like a little TSA pre-check, you know? Yeah, exactly. Get it. Get it, get it going. Yeah. Get it going. 

Speaker 7 

Well and. 

Speaker 1 

Love going? For the upper classmen that that this was for the seniors, it was only their second yacht dance, which is kind of. I know, but did you like the improvement? Did you notice the boat was different? Well, of course you wouldn't know that. You wouldn't have known because laughing. Seemed the same to me. It actually. Is different. This is a different boat. Wow. And this is this is the original one we would go on was called the Mystic Blue. Now we christened the spirit, the spirit of Chicago. There goes the bell truck. You know, I thought they would walk with the mailman, walked around in this night light car, but anyway. 

Speaker 5 

Chicago. 

Speaker 1 

It's now called the spirit of Chicago, and they had. They blew out some of the ceiling and now there's an atrium and a staircase that looked pretty nice. It did and. You know, especially Father Ralph got up onto the staircase and really made his presentation. He made his presence known and he showed off those medals. He had this like a. It felt like a full-fledged Admiral, you know? And he said this so gracefully. And you know, he normally wants to pat himself on the back and all this, but he let it know and it was for the. 

Speaker 5 

Plus. 

Speaker 1 

Kids and it really was for the kids, he. 

Speaker 6 

Yeah. 

Speaker 8 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

It's just. 

Speaker 1 

Made it so. Well, thanks Nicola. You know, I I wore this year, I wore a red like cutaway tuxedo top military. Wow. We got some epilepsy. Look, like some done, some like Dolly Parton epaulettes and and there was some metals, you know. And and I love this. You know, I do. There's somebody just bought our. 

Speaker 2 

There are some Italians on the tiger. 

Speaker 1 

Was on last. Some young lady says. You know, one of those medals for I said, well, this is for Notre Dame 2010 Notre Dame Day 20/11/2012. But you know I I it was it was funny. Next year I'll I'll add more stuff to it. Every year is going to go. And what was that? Only thing missing? But I can't do that. You know you can, you know, you know. Because you know why? Isn't it pretty? All the the flowers from the apple tree? Or is that falling down? 

Speaker 2 

You know, I didn't realize. 

Speaker 1 

That the trees becomes white and then go to the leaves. Last year I never got to see that because it was still cold before we left, so the trees did not grow back and. Everything is blossomed, it's. The birds are chirping. Yeah, it is. It's. It's full of life only right now. 

Speaker 6 

Right before you take classes play for. 

Speaker 1 

Your stoppers, we got some people, we've got people. Yeah, I said smart. Under smart. Under. Yeah. No, it's been it's been Martin. 

Speaker 3 

Class instead when. 

Speaker 2 

Wandering out, I don't even think those are no. 

Speaker 7 

There you go. 

Speaker 1 

That's Ben Ben Martin. Ben. Come over here, Ben. Can you? We're on the podcast here. We're just talking about yacht dance. How how was your yacht dance is your first. Yacht dance. Right. Sorry your second. 

Speaker 4 

Your second did we do? 

Speaker 1 

It last year. Oh, yeah, we did it last year. Yeah. OK. So this is your second dance. Yes. So what? What do you what do you? Think did you have? Fun did you? 

Speaker 9 

I had a really good time this year. 

Speaker 1 

Don't lie to this. Do you know it's OK and I'll have a good cry. Get over it. 

Speaker 9 

No, I. No, no, no. It was a great time. Had a good time. I like, I think everything about things is actually when you fall asleep on the bus and you just happen to wake up back at school. 

Speaker 1 

Let me ask, do they play your song? 

Speaker 

Alexa. 

Speaker 9 

Actually, they tried. You belong with him and she was Taylor Swift fan. So that was good. That was. 

Speaker 1 

Oh, OK, alright, alright. Well, fantastic. There you go. 

Speaker 9 

Good for. The culture. But yeah, had a good time. 

Speaker 1 

Very good. Yes, he does have his backpack on, so he is. He is off to the library, off to the races. You heard it here first, guys. Thank you. Don't say yeah, go study. 'S kid straight. A's he's. Don't study. You know? But you know what though the? Yacht dance is helping people. If you look over your left shoulder, you'll see one of your favorite idlers on campus, the Grubhub robot. 

Speaker 4 

Oh God. 

Speaker 1 

Ohh gosh I almost got hit by one of the. Tripped over it. It's like it's a brake checker. It really keeps you keeps you honest. Yeah. You know, the other thing too is I. Once got sandwiched one of. Those in the in a skateboard. And anyway, folks. That's another story, but I do want to say is that it was like this military code. And I said, you know, do I do? I do it, do we do the? Yacht dance for for this code. No, not even. Not even close. No, no. It's for the kids, for the. For the kids, and of course, we played the traditional. Song opening. No money, no promise. Know it's like. 

Speaker 7 

It's typical studs. 

Speaker 1 

You know, just keep. It real it's very wealthy and forget it, Dorians. 

Speaker 4 

This. Yeah, it's a very rough. 

Speaker 1 

That's that's hilarious neglect. Now I I always enjoy. Seeing everyone come on and shaking everyone's hand and it's so funny that there's people who are scared, you know, like the. Guests like who? You know what are. You why are you shaking your head? Welcome to our *****, you know. And then they didn't. That was then they ease up and stuff like that, but I. Was lifting that and you? Know I want to say thank you to all the people at city experience. The people who put on our cruise, we did a nice job. They're always very attentive. If we could just have some help from the security, that would be it would be really smooth. 

Speaker 

Yes. 

Speaker 1 

Now, as always next year, Father Alf, there's always next year. And by the way, you know, it was really nice. You had a perfect view of downtown Chicago with no clouds and and the seas were pretty like there was a little chop. It was, it was, it was glimmering. It was, it was gorgeous. Did you see the captain? I did not see the captain. I didn't see him either. Last year, I. He was a Taiwanese captain, drafting this year. I was not introduced to the captain. He did. 

Speaker 6 

Interesting. 

Speaker 1 

Good job though, right? Down to business, there's no. Time to fraternize with the. No, but I wanted to sit down and sit. At his table. And yeah, you. Know like, sit down and be asked to share, you know, Buffalo wings with the captain, you know, that's what. You. You show them a couple of tricks. Exactly. But that's. Yeah, exactly. Back in my. Yeah, I gotta ask. To do it. How was the boarding process? You know, so we get, we get onto the boat, they take our picture, you know? Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Freshman year I. 

Speaker 1 

Learned. I learned this lesson. I'm like, oh, great, this is gonna be such a great picture. I'm gonna get him in return. But you soon realize when you deboard the OR get off the boat, it's like the picture is like $20.00. So it's like I took enough pictures. The book where I got my money's worth without the $20. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

And then so you take your picture, you get on and then it's just like there's beautiful tables lined up. And then there's a dance floor. And then behind the dance floor, there's so much good food. It's like, yeah, you really could come hungry. And you feel full at the end. It's so. So everything was like a full experience. It was 5 stars. Why? There's really no one coming is still sleeping. That's wow. There really isn't, honestly. I went to. I woke up at 11, went to the bathroom and like the automatic lights were still off. So no one has gone to the. It was like every 5 minutes and no one had went to. The bathroom, it's. Hilarious. You know, it's so funny when people do come out, they say, hey, good. Morning. It's like, hey, it's afternoon. 

Speaker 5 

It's 2:00. 

Speaker 1 

So now this is this is now your second. Your second second. Yeah, dance second. Yeah, dance, you know. You've done it. Just as many as this user. 

Speaker 3 

I'm exam practically like. 

Speaker 1 

A skipper at this point, it's like. 

Speaker 3 

We have it's kind of crazy to. 

Speaker 1 

Think that and so. My date I took. She's been there. So this is her second year coming up, man. It's like, wow, you've been here also as much as the seniors I have. That, that's funny? Well, Dang it, COVID. You. You you really messed it. Yeah, you know? Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Know. Feel like? 

Speaker 1 

Well, I don't know. Do we need? To wrangle people. To come out here, you know? Gee whiz, folks, let's take we're going to take a commercial break and let's take a let's hear a word from our. Guess. Sponsor. OK. Thanks for tuning back in. You know it's it was. I think it was the. 21st Yacht Dance that we were on it. Was the 24th. Yeah, you know, my question is like, what did we do before the yeah dance? 

Speaker 2 

It seems like it's so. 

Speaker 1 

Typical stands well. We used to not do a dance and the last day, and I do know what we did used to do and we used to do a dinner. At medieval times, really. Yeah, and that went on, I think for three years until someone decided to jump in and be a part of the show and then and then we were asked not. 

Speaker 

That's. 

Speaker 1 

Not to. Return some back. I don't know how people thought that that this is ever a good idea to take 300 kids plus up to Chicago land to medieval times with dates. I have to say we have thoroughly upgraded from that. Upgraded we have upgraded. And Oh my gosh, look, he's look, get over here. You know what? Look who's coming here. He's calling Davidson. 

Speaker 7 

Wow, I didn't want. 

Speaker 1 

To interrupt. No, we. No, we need you. We need you. We're talking here on the podcast we're talking about not dancing here. Colin Davidson, first year student freshman from New York. Tuxedo park. How was your first yacht dance? 

Speaker 7 

Yeah, I had a great time. We had a nice dinner beforehand, got like 11 people over to our this Italian restaurant. And then. And then on the out the whole time, it was a great time. 

Speaker 1 

Did they play your song? 

Speaker 7 

They had good music. My favorite song was not played, but because I'm a classic rock guy, I like the song. My favorite song is dancing in the moonlight by king. 

Speaker 3 

Cheers. 

Speaker 6 

Oh yeah, should be. 

Speaker 7 

Heart. I love that song. Good one. 

Speaker 1 

That's a good one, especially moonlight out. 

Speaker 7 

But Oh yeah, would have been nice. 

Speaker 1 

On the boat. But you, but you like more money, more problems, OK. 

Speaker 7 

Ohh of course. OK and I get into the rap. I was there. I was bumping. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. And you know, and I would say. It was pretty smooth. Really, wasn't it? 

Speaker 7 

Yeah, well, a little bit of rocking, but you know, it just adds to the the ambience to the dance floor, just jumping around, moving around. 

Speaker 1 

Fantastic. So would you? Would you come back again? 

Speaker 7 

Ohh, I would totally come back again for any time as possible. Had a great time as well, Olivia.

Speaker 1 

I got a great. Picture of you and your day. I'm going to pass that. Thank you. How did it feel to now be hurting at the bottom of the boat? You know, that's where they. So the 21 year olds go to the bottom of the boat and then the underclassmen will party at. Like the middle floor. Of the boat. So how did that feel? Phenomenal.

Looking for more ways than one. College intimate one big crowd. So what was the highlight? Did you take pictures on the dot on the? 

Speaker 3 

Ohh yes, we did the outside. The outside was probably the greatest part. You look. 

Speaker 4 

On. Boat. 

Speaker 3 

Out you're in. The middle of. Lake MI and you see the Chicago skyline at night and it. 

Speaker 4 

Yes. 

Speaker 3 

Truly remarkable photo opportunities. Ohh. The lighting. The lighting was a little bit of a tough battle at first, but we we fought through it a little bit and we got some. 

Speaker 4 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Tremendous shots. 

Speaker 1 

We're we're. I got to ask did were there a lot of people on the on the on the deck? I didn't. Wow. 

Speaker 3 

There were tough times. Yeah, you had to, like, angle the camera. You didn't have a ton of people on your background. 

Speaker 1 

Well, that's I. Didn't that's funny. When you're downstairs in the 21 section, you don't really. You just don't want to go anywhere else. Exactly, you know. 

Speaker 3 

Having so much fun. 

Speaker 4 

Yeah, just keeping an eye on me. 

Speaker 1 

Keeping it real, keep it fresh. But yeah, it was packed up there and like there's times when the boat turns, then everyone has to move their position to get that perfect. Oh my. Gosh, no. Did you did you sample? Any of the the foods, the. 

Speaker 3 

Food. Yeah. So I had. I had a couple of. Lamp wars. The Mac and cheese is mediocre. Very. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

So compliment sandwich you wanted to. 

Speaker 4 

Yeah. Yeah, exactly. 

Speaker 1 

Come in and I like. I I the meatballs were fine. Yeah. I I usually stay away from macaroni and puddings. Yeah, they're just never going to be good. And why? Why? Why? I don't go to a boat to get macaroni in a great point. The water was great under 21 section of water was amazing. 

Speaker 7 

Fair enough. 

Speaker 4 

For pretty, but I mean, I actually agree with that. I love him that. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, especially when you're dancing out there and you're sweating up a storm. The big thing is like how was successful successful. We didn't sink yes. 

Speaker 4 

Hey. 

Speaker 1 

We weren't taking on water, that's for sure. Yeah, we were displacing one, but I I gotta say that, you know, if the boat did go down, heaven forbid I told the staff that we needed to stay in our positions, manning the ship and having the band play. What was it? The song where the Titanic went down. I forget it. There was a there was a song. That song, you know, that song. 

Speaker 4 

I know fun. 

Speaker 1 

That. Yes, and I'll I'll rearrange some chairs. 

Speaker 8

Speaker 9 

Veggie platter I was I. 

Speaker 1

Speaker 4 

We we love to die. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, that's your excuse. How does how does finals look for you? 

Speaker 8 

Ohh, absolutely terrible. 

Speaker 1 

But you had your fun. Exactly. Yeah. It's good. It's gonna. You're gonna coast now. See that puts wind in their sails. See nick? 

Speaker 8 

I had some fun. 

Speaker 2 

Exactly when's and they say all the good news is, yeah, the exams start on Monday, not. 

Speaker 1 

His. His alarms going. My dad give me a phone call. I bet we should like time to study to keep that away. Say hello to dad. All right. Thanks for joining us. You know, it's always good to hear stories. Like time to wake up? 

Speaker 8 

Alright, thank. 

Speaker 1 

Oh, it's. It is. It is now the crazy. Thing last year was we, so the. School ended the week early last year, so we got out on Tuesday and so they had exams on that Friday and it was like we get back Wednesday morning, we really don't have much time and I had two exams on Friday and Ohh boy, let's just say it was we had some turbulence on those exams. You know, I see that you. Getting a little red. So I think we should. Probably start going in. That's. You know, and so can we. Let's have some good news and. With. Oh my gosh, you. Know I I have so much good news and, you know. Yeah, dances on. I don't. We don't need to keep reading it. It's just it's just was amazing but. 

Speaker 7 

Yeah, I know. Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

You know, so this campus has got so many great things going on and you know, I'm looking at one of them is the the Dome. And so if you haven't heard, it's going to be re gilded. It's right after commencement on it will from it will be a five month process. They're going to do about 15 lbs of 23 3/4 karat gold will be. 

Speaker 4 

I know. 

Speaker 6 

That's. 

Speaker 1 

So they're going to file the. 

Speaker 2 

Gold down on the building and then, yeah, roll it back. 

Speaker 1 

On well, I tell you, it hasn't been done for 12 years and the gold is so thin that if you touch it, it would turn. Black. Really. Yeah. So you have they have to wear gloves and all that stuff and it's so thin. So this is not like, you know, like putting like. 

Speaker 6 

Chunks of gold. Really. Really. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, melting bars on the side. Yeah, you know, I read an article from 2005 or whatever like 2006 or whatever the last time they did it and it was saying so they had all the scaffolding from the ground up and they had to. So before they had no security at the scaffolding and students would scale the scaffolding and would go up and touch the Dome and and marry, and then they soon realized, well, that's it. That's a problem, you know, be pretty cool to say. I touched the Dome, but you know. Really a terrible that's they call. That. Nuisance. It isn't worth it, but no. So they they did post security and had security 24/7 at the scaffolding but but so we'll see how it goes next year. Maybe they hopefully they've learned their. 

Speaker 6 

Well, that's good. 

Speaker 1 

Lesson. Remember that now I thought you going to tell the story of what the studs guys. Did I do not? No, I know maybe a stage guy or two got up there and touched the Dome, but what they did is they actually. Took shavings of the Dome and stuck them in Mason jars and they had the Dome in the jar and it was a pretty good idea and the university got really upset. And wanted it back. 

Speaker 4 

Well, they were just they did the university. 

Speaker 1 

I don't blame them. Was just throwing it on the ground. They didn't. Care. They were throwing it out. It's like they were filing it. No, no, they were just throwing it down on the ground. There was trash and and then also the kids had the idea, let's. Put let's put it in a. Don't mind if we. Did and and that's what happened. And there you. Go well and the kids didn't give it back. Nor should they. Nor should they. 

Speaker 3 

Exactly. It was the the squirrels would have taken. 

Speaker 1 

It in? Yeah. And yeah, so wow it was. Like I was kind of surprised and as. Good as happening after commencement. Though. Yeah. You don't think fish pitch perfect? What any other? Oh, we sure do. So, you know, a couple of weeks ago, this is a little bit late. I haven't reported it yet, so it's it's still present news, but they have announced the new leprechauns for next year. And so two of them that did this year, we'll be doing it again next year. And then they're bringing on 2 new leprechauns, which are both females, which will be an enter. It will be. So exciting to see the. 

Speaker 2 

The different. Yeah. It's nice to get. 

Speaker 1

May the founder smile upon you on all of us, and I'm going to pull out a little cigar here. Let's smoke a little cigar as you go out here, you know, see how it goes. But anyway, so how has your Founders week been going?

Speaker 4 

It's been lovely. It has been lovely. We had, I saw. Old President Michael Lynch. 

Speaker 1 

Well, former, we don't call him. 

Speaker 4 

Old, still young, still young. Yeah, I actually saw him on the football game and I asked him about, I think, USC, how's life like? And he tells me that he starts going in about the working life and how hard it is. And they says. 

Speaker 6 

You're so young. He is. 

Speaker 1 

OK. Yeah, out in the wild. 

Speaker 4 

Ohh, by the way I started work on Tuesday. 

Speaker 8 

No, Sir. 

Speaker 1 

What a superstar. 

Speaker 4 

So, so well, it's like 10 minute conversation about how the working world was different and it told me he'd been working for four days. 

Speaker 9 

Great. 

Speaker 1 

Let's change seats because. I'm smoking cigars and hit the wind here. We're having a little smoke trade out here. Right in our days.

Speaker 4 

So into the bread. But I don't. I don't. I'm not. Pro in the bread making. 

Speaker 1 

So he's not a bread making. That's right. He's he's living with Kyle Bass and Jack Kelly. Cat, who are all making that bread, but yeah. 

Speaker 10 

That's right. 

Speaker 4 

We're just getting free bread. I'm a free leader.

For a free. 

Speaker 8 

Load. We are now going to ask. We. 

Speaker 1 

What is your favorite event of founders? 

Speaker 4 

What is my favorite event? It might be this one, but probably the rededication of the. 

Speaker 8 

Ohh. 

Speaker 1 

There you go. Another one you know we gotta rededicate. We gotta rededicate ourselves. And all of that stuff, you know, we got. To show. All of that stuff. Hey, Jack. Jack jacket. You know, we got to do that. You know, so we got to show respect and we got to play it up. You know, I don't know. I don't know if I like. I don't know if I like one day I like. I think, honestly, the best part is we're always smiling, always smiling. Why? Because this founder is always. 

Speaker 11 

All right, gentlemen. 

Speaker 10

Speaker 1 

Finally, on us may the founders smile. On you always. Well, that founder too. No, the founders fathers.

Speaker 1 

How's life off campus? 

Speaker 4 

The life on campus, let me tell you, they don't tell you how different it is, first of all. All this in here is just. Walk into their kids student center and you'll see half the senior class. 

Speaker 1 

Wow. So maybe we can charge special rent? Yeah. 

Speaker 13 

Probably that's what we could do. 

Speaker 4 

University to be making a lot of money to get into their kids. 

Speaker 15 

So do you have to drive to campus in? The mornings you walk.

Speaker 11 

Sorry. So anyway the semester. 

Speaker 1 

'S rolling on, everything's going now. 

Speaker 19 

I gotta ask. 

Speaker 11 

It's all about the experience. 

Speaker 9 

What do you? 

Speaker 19 

Think about our Notre Dame football chances. I hear that our bowl game could be the pop tarts. Listen, I love a pop tart myself, but here's my. My stance on this, OK, yeah. If we're not going new year. Six can we get like Hawaii Bowl or like Bahama Bowl? 

Speaker 11 

I agree. 

Speaker 9 

Like, give us something like that. 

Speaker 1 

Thank you. Thank you. I'm. I'm all for that. I mean, rifle in Detroit. No. Who wants that? I agree. 

Speaker 10 

Yeah, no one wants no. 

Speaker 9 

No, it's great for me because. 

Speaker 19 

I can go. 

Speaker 1 

Hawaii send us off. 

Speaker 19 

I'll take the Gator Bowl again if it means like Florida. 

Speaker 17 

Yeah. 

Speaker 8 

Palpable. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, I I don't know. How do you say like, oh, we're going to pop target. OK like. Congratulations. Like, how do you keep? A straight face. And how do you like, say, your dignity? You know, even just. 

Speaker 19 

You're gonna hang up a pop tart bowl championship like Banner. 

Speaker 1 

Just the merchandiser has like ohh you went. 

Speaker 10 

To the pub table and. 

Speaker 1 

When will this be enough? This mid-december, like December 5th, something. OK. Well, maybe I you know, if we go to the pop tart bowls, I think that we're. Going to be having a pop tart bar. 

Speaker 20 

Oh yes. 

Speaker 1 

Don't tell anyone and. Hush. Folks, if you're listening, don't tell your sons. Pop tarts all around. 

Speaker 18 

Yeah. 

Speaker 6 

We'll go to Costco and get. 

Speaker 1 

The family pack, just what I thought we. Could have won? Yeah. Who? Yeah. 

Speaker 11 

The good news is. 

Speaker 1 

We're always winning instead, so we. Are winning instead always? This is a hall of winners. We're winners. Now I got. To ask. Would you go to the pop? 

Speaker 19 

Tart ball, where is the pop purple I. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. Where is the postcard? I think it's Orlando. Is it? Ohh. And actually you're right. It isn't. 

Speaker 14 

Don't even know. 

Speaker 19 

I'm the child of Disney adults, so I'll. Probably be there. Anyway, but yeah, just drop. I don't. 

Speaker 8 

Ohh I. Dropped it. 

Speaker 1 

Got a little cigar mishap. There, but I don't even think I would go to the pop. Tart bowl to be honest with you all. Used to. 

Speaker 19 

I kind of want the T-shirt. It's a little. 

Speaker 17 

Oh, it is like. 

Speaker 19 

Have Notre Dame pop tampions. 

Speaker 1 

Oh yeah, that's gonna be a hot I'd buy one. Oh yeah, the books are my sell out. Living fast. You know, it is a hot T-shirt, though. The Founders week shirt. Ohh I I've been seeing it all week and too hot to handle and that's. 

Speaker 8 

Of the what? 

Speaker 20 

It's it is too. 

Speaker 8 

That it's literally hot. 

Speaker 1 

Hard to handle. Yeah, it's, you know, and and folks, if you don't. Know it's actually a retro. Line taken from the 80s after the hall burnt down to the 4th floor burned down. They said we will rise from our ashes. We will rise again as it's Phoenix coming out of the. Ashes and it's. It is hot, it is hot, too hot to handle. And so next thing you know, everyone's wearing it. Oh, my gosh. Well, it's nice to talk with them. 

Speaker 10 

After us. 

Speaker 11 

Look who's here. 

Speaker 19 

Amazing to talk with you. Maybe again next time in New Jersey next. 

Speaker 1 

Over. Next. On the shore store? Yeah and no storms this time. Yeah. Look, as soon as he goes, look who popped it. Ohh. Who popped in? Jacob flood. Pop singer. Come out the pop tart bowl. Pop tart. 

Speaker 19 

I'm just sure everything's alright. 

Speaker 9 

Oh my. 

Speaker 10 

Oh, oh, Jacob sooner. 

Speaker 5 

Popped our ball. Yeah, you know, disappointing, disappointing season, but. 

Speaker 10 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

And it's silver lining and it's tasty. Who doesn't want a pop tart? I. Agree. Do we know our? Opponent, yet no. 

Speaker 10 

Now, well, I. 

Speaker 1 

Or if we're going there. We don't even know if we're going. 

Speaker 5 

I thought it was going to be LSU, I actually. But that would be interesting. 

Speaker 1 

That would be something else. I would go if we played in the POP chart poll and we played against Brian Kelly. I'd be all over that. That's that's what I Orlando. 

Speaker 5 

The liar, where is the pop tart pool? Orlando. OK. That could. That could be a destination, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

His hometown. Yeah. You know, everyone just pile into my house. Yeah. You know, 1010 to bed. I'll take everyone. The waffle Waffle House for breakfast. Or maybe look about the oil breakfast of pop tarts.

Yeah, we learned about the history and the traditions. 

Speaker 14 

Of your hall. 

Speaker 5

Speaker 5 

What other school can you have the fear? Of getting a football dropped in your. Head while doing a podcast.

Speaker 5 

Are the odds you know transfer in? There's how many doors here, 3031. 

Speaker 1 

3131 and you got you got like it's it's like you know he's a part of the jersey. That's the. The pipeline taking it over. 

Speaker 20 

You know this will be like. 

Speaker 1 

Miss West. Well, you know you. You you did get the lottery. You hit the lottery. Jackpot. That's right. That's right. Now, did you also take advantage because we are having a campaign. I don't know. If we didn't totally talk about this at EDC. 

Speaker 5 

Yeah, for real. 

Speaker 1 

You jackpot. You know, we're we're having nugs chicken Nuggets because unfortunately we're looking too much money on them because everyone insists that everything be $2.00. So we just couldn't. The margins just weren't there since. We brought him back just for this weekend as a part of our NUGS not drugs campaign. Yeah, it is. 

Speaker 5 

It's all a campaign. 

Speaker 1 

A solid campaign. 

Speaker 5 

I mean looking. I I heard about it for the first time. I think it was at mass and I was like. 

Speaker 9 

Easy. 

Speaker 5 

I I gotta get on top of this. Yeah. Yeah. Say yes to nuts. 

Speaker 2

Who knows? 

Speaker 6 

Wow, he's he. 

Speaker 1 

Shouldn't for the, he shouldn't for. The stars there. I like that you know. Away anchors. 

Speaker 11 

So. 

Speaker 1 

Away. Ohh right. Well, let me ask, what do you think is our? Chances of beating Wake Forest. 

Speaker 5 

Wake Forest. So it's it's a Sam Hartman revenge. So we know that he's going to show out. 

Speaker 20 

Yes. 

Speaker 5 

A little if you. Call the backside and it's like, OK, game against who was it again on Clemson, you know, USC, although we had a dominant offensive performance, it was like he was aided a lot by the defense. 

Speaker 1 

Exactly. 

Speaker 5 

But you know, I think this is the time where he stands up. He shows, you know, I came to Notre Dame for a reason. I don't need you anymore. Wake Forest. So I think he's going to show out, you know. 

Speaker 8 

Oh. 

Speaker 5 

Get get 2. 3-4 touchdowns, maybe a rushing touchdown? Just. 

Speaker 10 

Ohh wow. 

Speaker 5 

Just to put it in the. But I like. I like his chances. I think. I think there's going to be a lot of push-ups from this fan. Yeah. Yeah, I guess so. 

Speaker 1 

So no nerves. 

Speaker 20 

A lot of push-ups, so. 

Speaker 1 

I'll get that arm workouts going early. That's you know, I'm always a little bit nervous. 

Speaker 10 

Yeah, especially when I'm more nervous. 

Speaker 1 

As a fan, no, it's it's next weekend. But. 

Speaker 5 

Is it raining this weekend? Next week? 

Speaker 20 

It will be. 

Speaker 1 

Cold, but I'll look forward on that later. We.

Speaker 1 

OK, let's not mention that. 

Speaker 18 

Yeah, we all mentioned the other hall that I was originally put in, but housing had to work some magic over some other issues that went on in that hall and. I guess you can just thank the founder for. 

Speaker 1 

And the founder, by the Grace of God. Thank the founders. 

Speaker 18 

By the grace of God, I was moved into stead.

Speaker 1 

Well, you know, you don't always say give them more distractions. To take away how bad they are, put glitter on them. Smoke show.

Transcript 

Speaker 1 

I'm Father Ralph and you're in the red room tonight. We're going to hear from Robert Klein, Jack Kelly, head and Michael Mitchell. Sophomores and mullet wearers later, we'll hear from Aidan Tompkins, stead sophomore and comedian. That's no joke. All of this is happening in the red room and this special edition of the Red Room snowmageddon 20. 22 tonight I'm joined by my host Nate McKeon. All this is happening in the red room. Nate's father, Al Snow again. Indeed it is. It is snow day. Snow day about that. 

Speaker 2 

Read all about it folks. Class is canceled. Schools shut down. But you know what they can't keep. The red room. From from. Recording exactly any snow is melting in here. 

Speaker 1 

No, it's red. Hot. Red hot. Yeah, it's not shutting down. It's. Just. Exactly. You know, it's what's so funny is someone said to me, you know, kids were like coming to me. Are we gonna have a snow day? Are we gonna have a snow day? And I said, well, you know, we'll just have to wait and see. And I was thinking all along we'll probably find out the morning of. Yeah, we'll wait till the very last minute. Mm-hmm. But I kept it. Didn't stop me from going around last night and spreading rumors. And so, like, so the kids would say, I would see the kids. And I would say, hey, did you hear about classes tomorrow? And they're like, what? 

Speaker 2 

What? 

Speaker 1 

Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you heard something about. Oh, I don't know. 

Speaker 2 

Ohh I must have ohh sorry. 

Speaker 1 

That's good. 

Speaker 2 

Nothing to rile him up like that. 

Speaker 1 

So what did you find out that? 

Speaker 2 

You had a snow day. I found out this morning when they sent out the. E-mail I was sent. 

Speaker 1 

At 5:42 AM. 

Speaker 2 

Exactly. And I was up for it. Trust me, you know? Yeah. 

Speaker 

Oh yes. 

Speaker 2 

I was definitely up for it. 

Speaker 1 

Legal legal scholar that. 

Speaker 2 

You. Exactly. I I couldn't help but think immediately of back in my I I was a member of the class of 2017 year in undergrad and I think it was the winter of. 2014 my. Freshman year, we had a cold snap polar vortex thing where I think it was about 40. Below 0 and. They gave us 1/2 day off I think. And so. Just a sign that the the times are changing. I think we were made of sterner stuff back. Then. 

Speaker 1 

That's right. Yeah, I think yeah, perhaps so. 

Speaker 2 

I hate to be the old man waving his fist at the sky, but hey, now I get to enjoy both. 

Speaker 1 

Your father, what about you? Well, you know, I knew that we had a snow day because I didn't hear any clanking in the gym. There was no one doing the early morning workout, so I could sleep. Now, if you don't know or listeners don't know, my room is closest to the gym and we have a crawl space. So there's it's not like there's some. There's nothing underneath. And so those reverberations go right. Not in my room, so I can hear every pound. That's dropped on the ground. And so it wasn't clanging this morning. So I said, oh, my gosh, we must have a snow day. And I rolled over and kept sleeping. 

Speaker 2 

Perfect. That's the perfect way to start Snow day. 

Speaker 1 

It is, it is, and there's a lot of kids who are hoping for a second snow. 

Speaker 2 

Day. Yeah, that could be a real treat. Because thing for them because. 

Speaker 1 

We're we're in for a real snow. Job here. I mean it's. 

Speaker 2 

NSJ yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Yes, Jay, you know, we gotta get anywhere from 10 to 20 inches of snow over 2 days. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, I we haven't even I think at least today is the lighter end of it. It's supposed to get even worse tonight. So it only makes sense so. 

Speaker 1 

The lighter end, yeah. Yeah. What I found out is the dining halls are. Open, thank goodness. And they're really not cleaning the sidewalk. So you're really staying in? I found out that the huddle is open, Father Terry ventured over there early in the morning, cause he had, you know, he hadn't prepared. And so he went to go get some milk. You know, last night. Yes. I went to the Martins and it was like a madhouse. 

Speaker 

Oh. 

Speaker 2 

I don't. Milk is precious. That's perfect. I bet I'm sure it was. Yeah, people stocking up. 

Speaker 1 

He was insane. Snow again, snow begin and rec. 

Speaker 2 

Snowmageddon. 

Speaker 1 

Sports is open. Till 9:00 PM. Wow, they have enough. Yeah, they have enough student workers on campus to. Keep it open. So which is good. 

Speaker 2 

That's great. Wow. They're making a lot of. Facilities open for us. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, they are. 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

Campus is a good. 

Speaker 1 

Place to be, but I think I think really what it is is just a day to cuddle up with Netflix or whatever platform you want and just binge watch. Yes, whatever you want. If. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, it's too. It's too rough outside. Just stay inside. 

Speaker 1 

Stay inside record a podcast, listen to a podcast, whatever you want exactly. And Speaking of podcasts. Our podcast is now on.

It should take him maybe three to five days, well within 20. Minutes we were approved. Wow. So he's, he's. He knows what he's doing. 

Speaker 2 

Nikolai. He's. Yeah. We should probably pay him or something.

Speaker 1 

You know what else is being brought to us? 

Speaker 2 

What's the? 

Speaker 1 

Shocking story coming out of Bensalem, PA. 

Speaker 2 

Oh, that's sleepy little town. 

Speaker 1 

That's sleepy little town. Well, there was. 

Speaker 2 

A riot there. No kidding. Over what? 

Speaker 1 

It was a riot at the local Golden Corral. 

Speaker 2 

OK, please don't have her. Yes. 

Speaker 1 

There was a rumor that there was a shortage of steak, and I folks, you can go online and you can find this. And it was it was just a madhouse. A riot broke out and, you know, and it all started when someone jumped the line. And then there was a shortage of stake. 

Speaker 2 

Oh boy. Well, that'll happen when you got line cutters like that, that'll. That'll upset some folks. 

Speaker 1 

You, you you know what is wrong with America? You know what is wrong with America? 

Speaker 2 

You heard a little bit. 

Speaker 1 

Of stink and yeah, you go bonkers, but what? Is wrong. We all know that if you're trying. Stretch your restaurant dollar. You go to Olive Garden. 

Speaker 2 

That's right. What are we? What are? What are these folks even doing in a Golden Corral? I have to assume Ben Salem has an Olive Garden. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

And so, you know, they're wasting their time at the golden. 1st place because they can get anything they want and more at the Olive Garden and it's. It's so much better and when you know your family and you don't like it, you don't like it. Families don't, right? It's not my kind of family at the Golden Corral. 

Speaker 1 

No, no, no. So I asked, you know, I asked the staff here at the stead, staff, what what would cause a riot. One of the Notre Dame dining halls. 

Speaker 2 

Oh, great question. 

Speaker 1 

So. So I'm going to ask you for your thoughts, but here's what our some of our guys said. So there would be a riot on the level of the riot at the Golden Corral at Bensalem if. The Duddy Hall staff told John Delayla to take normal portions. He's another member of our staff. That's right. There would be a riot at the dining hall if the staff ever served real steak. Yeah, that's very true. John. Delilah says there would be a riot. 

Speaker 2 

Correct. 

Speaker 1 

If the staff. Ever got rid of the omelette? 

Speaker 2 

Bar, I think that's a valid 1. 

Speaker 1 

Yes, and Eliquis said there would be a riot if they got rid of the burger station. 

Speaker 2 

Oh, also fair, you know? Yeah, I think. Are there any more, any more responses from, you know, just of course, yeah. We can't be on the airwaves. 

Speaker 

Yes. 

Speaker 1 

No, if there there are, but I. Can't say them. This has to be a little decor. 

Speaker 2 

I think I would. I would take it back. I think it was the 80s where there was, there were student riots. Well, not riots, but student protests. When they tried to take away certain cereals. From the dining. 

Speaker 

Hall. 

Speaker 1 

Hmm. 

Speaker 2 

I I I heard the stories from my mom that back in the day that happened and the students organized unionized and they got their. The cereal back. Well, so, so who knows? Maybe that could even spark? A ride here. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. I mean, it sounds like we're living in one big powder keg, but we actually did have the closest thing to a. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Yeah, exactly. 

Speaker 1 

In 2009, when student activities. You know they. They they serve those hot dogs, remember? What they called. 

Speaker 2 

Quarter dot. 

Speaker 1 

Corner dogs at midnight every night, you can go to the fortune and get quarter. 

Speaker 2 

That's right, yes. 

Speaker 1 

Dogs for a. Quarter well. 

Speaker 2 

Mm-hmm. That's a yeah. What a. 

Speaker 1 

Deal in 2009. They try to change it to 35. 

Speaker 2 

Cents. Ohh brother and people went bonkers. Well, rightfully so. A corner dog can't be worth $0.35, you know? No and not no quarter in a dime. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

I don't think. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Well, that that is close. As we came to ride, it's. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, that's right. Well, thank God calmer heads. 

Speaker 1 

Prevail. Yes, I hope we don't have our golden. Corral moment here. So. So how's everything going in your world? 

Speaker 2 

No, it's going well, Father. You know, as, as you know, Kristen, my fiance and I. Have been just going through the motions of wedding planning. We're walking down a lot of things looking for a band. We're trying to figure. 

Speaker 1 

Oh. Wow. 

Speaker 2 

Out, you know. Menu song, that sort of stuff. Well. 

Speaker 1 

Now I know. That that's tough, though it is. It's really tough. It's really time consuming, isn't it? 

Speaker 2 

Ohh. Sure is, father. 

Speaker 1 

You know, contacting them, playing phone tag, doing these emails, you know, I know you're active lifestyle you do and I know you're your academic too. You know, you you're. Yeah. You're. Yeah. And then you're trying to throw in the third ball to juggle this wedding plan. That's tough, man. Yeah. Yeah, something.

Speaker 2 

Exactly, yeah. Ohh really? I appreciate I welcome any assistance, father. 

Speaker 1 

You know I've never. Well, I you know, I'm, I I I've never. Planned a wedding. But I've been to a lot of weddings and I've seen a lot of weddings. I've seen the trends and what's in, what's out? I was just, you know, at a wedding, you know, in January 6th, and Maggie and Jay Mathis down there in Atlanta. 

Speaker 2 

Hot hot Lantern. 

Speaker 1 

And so in the in the ATL and what they did at the reception was they did their dance first. Couples dance first. So I think I could help out on that. 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 1 

And you know, music. I could choose the music for you. I. You show me like you know so. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Great musical taste, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

So I can help you there and I have some selections. 

Speaker 2 

I'd love to hear him, Father. I think our. Listeners would too. What do you what do you got? First dance suggests. 

Speaker 1 

But you can't go wrong with. 

Speaker 2 

Tina Turner. No, you never can. 

Speaker 1 

Or is or who who sings it? I wanna dance with somebody. And that's Whitney Houston. Yeah. Whitney, Whitney Houston. I I want to dance with someone.

Speaker 1 

That's a good. One, you know, that's a you can't go wrong with, that's. No, that's a crowd pleaser, too. That's everybody on their feet. And maybe, maybe you could do something like UM. Uh, you know another song like you know somebody from the 60s, I think was Fifth Dimension. It might be a song about drugs, drug preferences. Everyone seemed to like. It was up, up and away in my wonderful. Balloons we can. 

Speaker 2 

Yes, you're OK. 

Speaker 1 

Fly. Come on. There. Come. That's a good.

Speaker 2 

Overlook. Yes, yes, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

You know, look like there's two young people flying out to the moon. 

Speaker 2 

What drug is more powerful than love? 

Speaker 1 

That's right. I think when they sang the song about that too. 

Speaker 3 

Maybe. 

Speaker 1 

But how about this one? Here's a dark horse. What happens if we didn't go for a song, but instead? 

Speaker 2 

Ohh. 

Speaker 1 

We went for a theme song from a sitcom. OK, I'm listening about the theme from The Love Boat, something exciting and new love won't hurt anymore. 

Speaker 2 

How? Yeah, I had a feeling. You're gonna. 

Speaker 1 

It's an oak. It's a smile on a friendly shore. You know, flow. It flows back to you. I'm all above. Climb aboard The Love Boat. I I really. 

Speaker 2 

Well. Hey, it's. 

Speaker 

It's. 

Speaker 2 

I'll just run these by Kristen. I feel like she might want all three, actually. 

Speaker 1 

Well, you know what we can do that you know, wow, that was a surprise. 

Speaker 2 

So we'll we'll take more than 1000 so far. So if you want to just curate our entire playlist, we'll we'll contact a band and we'll just let him know what set we want to do. 

Speaker 1 

Go, they say, don't worry. I can come up with. A selection I'll get. 

Speaker 2 

Back to. So that's perfect, Father. Thank you. 

Speaker 1 

Well, I think we should take a pause right now and let's go to one of our field reporters and hear about the weather where he's at. OK, now we go out to our reporter in the field, Chris Scott, who's going to tell us about. The weather where he's at, Chris. 

Speaker 4 

Alright. Thanks, father Ralph. Well, the weather in DC is looking pretty good today. I'm downtown in the foggy bottom slash West End area and it looks like it's mostly sunny. I believe it's in the mid 40s. So it's warmer than it's been lately. And so it's a good opportunity to go out there and go for a walk and get some sunshine. 

Speaker 

All right. 

Speaker 2 

Wow, excellent things are looking up in the foggy bottom, huh? Anything but bottom. 

Speaker 1 

That's right. 

Speaker 4 

Back to you. 

Speaker 1 

OK, now we'll head out to another field reporter, Josh Gambardella, and he's going to tell us about the weather, where he's at. Josh, are you there? 

Speaker 3 

Yes, I'm here, father Ralph. Thank you. It's a pleasure. To be here in the red room. We are in lovely and right now, very white, Long Island, New York. It's cold. We've got about a foot of snow over the weekend. But you know it's not stopping me. I'm still outside in my shorts. You know, but hey. There's a cold front coming in towards the end of the week, so it's gonna get. A little chillier. But on a in a more important note, I believe an Ethel Willis in New Hyde Park, Long Island, turned 112 today. Wow. 

Speaker 2 

Ethel, very nice. 

Speaker 3 

Ethel, all the best to Ethel. All the best of my steps. Family. Go, gentlemen. Back to. 

Speaker 1 

You thank you so much, Josh. Stay warm. And now we go out to another field reporter. None other than Pat Dignan. Pat, tell us about the weather where you're at. 

Speaker 5 

Hey, it's Pat Dickman here in San Francisco. Just like in South Bend, from the sounds of it, teachers also do not want to work. 

Speaker 1 

And. How's the weather? 

Speaker 5 

What is OK little bit better than it is in South Bend. 

Speaker 1 

All right. Well, that was most enlightening. Thank you, pat. OK, our first guest tonight are none other than Robert Klein of California. Michael Mitchell of Georgia and Jack Kelly. Cat. Calico. There you go from Florida. 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 1 

Welcome, gentlemen. Thank you for having us. 

Speaker 3 

Appreciate it. 

Speaker 2 

Do you do you really? 

Speaker 1 

Of. Alright, OK. It sounds convincing. OK, I'll take it now, Nate. Look here, all of these three sophomores hate malaria. 

Speaker 2 

Oh, I can tell. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. Our our, our listeners can't. But folks, if you were here, you would see big mobs of flopsy hair well with one of them has a hat on trying to hide it. But you can't cause it's blowing out on the side. 

Speaker 2 

You can't. 

Speaker 1 

Now you know, they just don't like malaria. But. And I know you want to get mullets, but how do you know you're ready to get your mullet? 

Speaker 2 

Oh. 

Speaker 6 

You see, father, that's the. Thing you don't need to get. Ready when you're born. Ready. 

Speaker 1 

Ohh I yeah. 

Speaker 2 

I like that. That's a great response. 

Speaker 3 

I'm a firm believer. 

Speaker 6 

In the fact that. Every man at one point in his life needs to have a mullet, and we just so happen to have a cause to do so. We hate malaria. I was born ready to be here. Let's get these molds going. 

Speaker 1 

You know what I like? That a lot because you know, you know what, Nate? It reminds me, you know, like, you know it, punching your man card. I. Think when you fix a tire. 

Speaker 6 

Absolutely. 

Speaker 1 

When you shave, yes. Yep, when you park a boat. 

Speaker 

Yeah. Ohh yeah, that's that's a good one right there, big fan. 

Speaker 1 

I did that last summer. No kidding. 

Speaker 5 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Of the park in a yacht. 

Speaker 1 

Well, it was all. 

Speaker 5 

I mean that's that's the. 

Speaker 1 

Nebraskan. Anything. Yeah. OK. And rubber digging and getting the mullet. That's, that is. That's punching your man part. 

Speaker 2 

That totally is. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, I like that a lot. 

Speaker 2 

And now we just found a way to kind of funnel that, you know, into a good cause. Yes, channel it for a great cause. 

Speaker 1 

Channel yes, channel, that Channel, that energy using. Yeah. Take it down. We're taking down malaria. Are you? How do you know you're ready, Jack?

I'm Father Ralph, and you're in the red room on the road. That's why I thought it's a special broadcast of the in the bedroom. And I'm here with my co-host, Bobby Wellner and Chris Scott in the Windy City of Chicago, IL. We're going to be hearing from all the salesman in the Chicago Land area soon enough. Before they do, I want to say welcome. To Bobby, and welcome to Chris. 

Speaker 2 

Father out. Great. Great to be on the road with you again. Last time. Last time we were on the road. We're in New York City, you know, back in. 

Speaker 1 

That's right. 

Speaker 2 

My. Neck of the woods, East Coast. 

Speaker 1 

East. 

Speaker 2 

And now we're in. This is this is territory. 

Speaker 1 

Back, yeah. Yes, we're here. Thanks to Chris. We're here at your place downtown here. We're broadcasting from the 23rd floor of the 8th. 

Speaker 4 

Heron 8 E Heron. Yeah, and it is a beautiful day. The sun is shining and just coming in here. Oh, it's a. It's a beautiful day in Chicago. 

Speaker 1 

The Easter I'm. You know, you know, yesterday was not so. 

Speaker 3 

Uh. 

Speaker 1 

Beautiful yesterday was one of those snowy Midwest days with cold and springtime, and spring is not here yet. It may be meteorological spring, but it's not astronomical spring. Yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 4 

I know. So yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Yesterday reminded us of that, but I gotta say one thing that I'm shot by and I'm still bewildered by is daylight savings. 

Speaker 4 

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Now, why? Why are you with bewildered? Why? 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, but given the time in which we live. And all the advancements we've made. Why do we do this? Tell. Tell me why? Why do we need this? The farmers, the farmers, I don't, really. 

Speaker 4 

Originally for farmers, I mean and it's like, you know and you know, we can still we can still keep it and we. 

Speaker 2 

Have a good answer. 

Speaker 4 

Have kept it for for. For many years, but you know, I feel. Like our our. Our economy might not be as dependent on our agriculture. That. Was, you know, as it was before. So I don't know, it's like maybe we could consider, you know, getting rid of daily savings time. 

Speaker 1 

Yes. 

Speaker 2 

I think I think you're just better father off because you know we we just sprang ahead an hour this past Sunday, which meant Father's birthday was cut an hour. Right, because his birthday was on Sunday. So I think, you know, he got jipped. He only got a 20. 

Speaker 1 

Well, Bobby. 

Speaker 2 

Three hour birthday. 

Speaker 3 

And so I think. 

Speaker 2 

He's just a little bitter right now. 

Speaker 1 

Well, you know, I, you know, I I it might be that, but actually what it is it throws off my circadian rhythm. I mean that one hour mess around with that and you're you're messing around with my internal body clock stop that. 

Speaker 5 

Oh yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Right, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

I hate to say it, but if you were not. Worried about your circadian rhythm? Good job for you. There's a lot of. 

Speaker 1 

Folks, he's coming out and he's swinging. Bobby, he's swinging for the fences here. He's not. He's not holding back today. No, you know, like I I'm not. I'm. I'm serious. I think there's. 

Speaker 4 

And that's fine. 

Speaker 6 

Always like some. 

Speaker 1 

Report that comes. Out that says you know, when we have the the these time changes, accidents go up, productivity goes down. Yeah, exactly. All this stuff. So let's just not do it. Let's be like the. 

Speaker 4 

Yeah, people have heart attacks. Right. 

Speaker 1 

State of Arizona. Or Hawaii. Or unfortunately, former South Bend, because South Bend didn't do it for years. Wow. But and it was perfect. Perfect. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Well, I think you'll get your wish, because I think we are doing away with it in a year or two, right? It's not the latest. 

Speaker 1 

Well, if that is the the protect the sunshine. Act. Introduced by Rubio, Florida passes the Senate. Then yes, I think there's a chance it could pass the house and pass the Senate. I think people are just tired of this. 

Speaker 7 

Now I mean well. 

Speaker 1 

I mean, did you did? It affect you this time change. 

Speaker 4 

You younger folk? I I don't. I I don't know. Maybe a little bit. I mean, I. Feel like I I. Don't know. Maybe the you know, maybe the last couple days. I you know, I I felt a little sluggish at some points but you. 

Speaker 1 

There you go. 

Speaker 4 

Know I can. I you know, it's like I can still go about my business. And you know, I feel like I've slept really well the last couple of nights. 

Speaker 1 

You know you're not. You're not helping. You're not helping the case. Right? But what? I'm really an old an old guy. You know, I I need. I I can take a nap right now. OK. Yeah, maybe 9. You know, I'm. I'm half baked when you pulled me. 

Speaker 4 

Yeah, you need your 8 hours. It's sun. 

Speaker 3 

Town. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 4 

Yeah, you know, I I I saw a headline about I I saw a headline about about sleep on the elevator here earlier today and I think it basically said. 

Speaker 1 

Out, you know with the. Clock door and off, yeah. 

Speaker 8 

Yeah. 

Speaker 4 

That, you know, like most, most people, most people don't get enough sleep. Anything. Well, you know there, there, there might not be a mystery there. But you know, it's like I think it's that, you know, I think yeah. Some people looked at data from Apple watches and I think they found that. Only one third of the users got the, you know, got the you know the the minimum 7 hours. Of sleep, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Well, I never get. Well, so I'm one of those I. Don't know. I try to go shoot for six. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

And then the body wakes up me up at 5:00. And then the body minds for the war and the mind wins out. Get up, Bobby. Let's go. I'm sorry. You gonna say Bobby? 

Speaker 4 

Already. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Well, I generally you know, if you're getting sick, I'm probably getting 5 because you know, I get up earlier than you so that I can work out. 

Speaker 9 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

And. Pray and then I can go take, you know. Then I can walk on campus while you're still. 

Speaker 1 

I. 

Speaker 2 

Just in the process of getting up. 

Speaker 4 

And you're telling us about your trailer? 

Speaker 3 

Ohh yeah. 

Speaker 1 

I pray before you pray, Bobby, I I get up and I pray. But you get up and work out. And then you. Pray, I pray. I pray, then I work out. Revision yes, yes, go ahead. 

Speaker 2 

Good to be fair to you, Father. So, yeah, I mean. 

Speaker 10 

Oh, thank you I. 

Speaker 2 

I have changed. I I did not have any problem with the time change, spring ahead fall back. Either way, I'm going to get up and. 

Speaker 4 

Yeah, it's. 

Speaker 2 

All of it, but. 

Speaker 3 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

OK, I do think I saw someone in Chicago today who may have had trouble with time change. 

Speaker 1 

Preacher Dennis Rodman. Ohh my father. 

Speaker 9 

Right. 

Speaker 4 

So did you guys, did you guys really see Dennis Rodman at the Smith today? 

Speaker 7 

Father Ralph and I. 

Speaker 2 

Saw Dennis Rodman out at lunch at this. 

Speaker 1 

Now this is funny. We're walking down the street and I said I said, Bobby, I wish I could remember where I ate brunch with some Stinson in here before wedding. It was really, really good. And Bobby spent. We'll describe. 

Speaker 3 

Wow. 

Speaker 1 

Well, all I remember was just a bunch of white. And black tile and right. Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

And it didn't remind me. 

Speaker 3 

Of New York City. 

Speaker 1 

So reminding New York City. Yeah, and load the whole. We were standing right outside it. Yeah. Perfect. And then we go in and I'm trying to get a table and bodies look around and he's zeroes in at the bar and sees Dennis Rodman. 

Speaker 9 

Oh my God. 

Speaker 1 

Clear his day. 

Speaker 2 

Dennis Rodman and he had a hat on sunglasses on. But yeah, you can't mistake those tattoo. Because you can't mistake the nose ring. You also can't mistake the T-shirt that he was wearing that says. 

Speaker 4 

Dennis Rodman would never guess that he'd be wearing that, you know, a T-shirt that says Dennis Rodman on. 

Speaker 1 

If he had any reminder. 

Speaker 2 

And he was with the perfect entourage, too. He had a guy, he had a guy. Well, he was there with a woman and a man and the. And was bright blue hair. Yeah, it's quite the quite the groove. And and I said to father off, I'm like, I need to get a photo with Dennis now. 

Speaker 9 

Oh wow. Wow. 

Speaker 1 

Now he yeah, he went and went to go get a photo and here. I'm trying to order. Food because I'm hungry and he goes off for like, you know, 10 minutes. 

Speaker 4 

I don't know about that, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

I need to plan my course of action so so I walked by the scene. I scoped it out and then went down to the bathroom just to like think OK, how am I going? To go up and approach Dennis. And it, and it was not undue preparation, it was, it was much needed because it wasn't. He wasn't particularly receptive to me coming out to. And I said I said Dennis can't get a. 

Speaker 9 

Hello. 

Speaker 2 

Photo. And I think at first he was trying to give me the. Cold. Shoulder and ignore me, but then he's like, OK, look. 

Speaker 10 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

I don't do selfies. The only condition is it can't be a selfie. It needs to be taken by someone else. And I said, I said OK, so I had the waitress. I said, do you mind taking a photo for us and then then, yeah, he gave a little kind of hang loose motion with his, with his hand and said spread the love spread the love. And then we. 

Speaker 1 

Hang loose. Wow. 

Speaker 2 

Took. Photo and and then then I said I said, God bless you, Dennis. And then. 

Speaker 4 

Is it out for government? 

Speaker 2 

And then I joked to the guys that I sent the photo back to some of the guys in the seminary and I said, look, I now have two degrees of separation from Kim Jong. UN. So maybe North Korea? 

Speaker 9 

Yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Is our new mission territory right? I can work. My dentist Rodman connection. Get in with Kim Jong Un. The Catholic Church thriving in North Korea. Wow. All because of lunch. 

Speaker 3 

Ohh wow. 

Speaker 4 

I mean, have you guys seen the documentary? I mean, have you guys seen the documentary Dennis Robbins, Big Bang in Pyongyang? 

Speaker 9 

No. 

Speaker 4 

It it it came, it came out. It came out years ago, maybe about 10 years ago. I know the the the title is hilarious. Maybe they, you know, they they they could have, you know, could have made a wiser choice of words. But anyway, I mean, it's all about when, like in early 2014, I think. Dennis Rodman and a bunch of NBA All Stars actually went to North Korea to Pyongyang for like. You know, they they were. They were, you know, they were going to play a basketball game with the, you know, the North Korean national team. And apparently, basketball is pretty big there, if I remember correctly. Or was the bad time and, you know, and it's like it it it wasn't, you know, it wasn't just about the basketball game was also about. 

Speaker 9 

Yeah. 

Speaker 4 

You know the politics behind their visit. You know, it's like and, you know, I think at one point, you know, Dennis, you know, Dennis pointed out that one day this store is going to open. And you know, I I just, I remember at some points in the movie he was, you know, I think he was. I think he was sitting with Kim Jong and and I think a few years ago I was saying that, you know, Dennis Rodman seems to be the only person who who gets along with Kim Jong Un. Right. And you couldn't pick two more different people. I mean, you know, it's. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. 

Speaker 4 

You know Dennis Rodman? We all know him. He's very eccentric, you know, very and very out there. And, you know, but like, you know, it was, it was, but. 

Speaker 1 

Flamboyant in your face. He's got that really stylish haircut. 

Speaker 2 

This is part of the problem. This is why I'm saying to bring you back for a moment. 

Speaker 11 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

This is why I think the father's credit. Yeah, I mean the, the whole daylight savings time thing throwing people off. Dennis Rodman was, you know, he was not particularly, you know, Accenture today he was he was, he seemed, he seemed pretty sedate and he was out at he was out at noon getting lunch. 

Speaker 

He was not. 

Speaker 1 

In the no sedate, he said yes last. 

Speaker 2 

Strike me as the person who. Gets lunch at noon, no? 

Speaker 4 

Maybe you woke up on the. Wrong side of the bed, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Yes, well, I gotta ask I. Guess true? I gotta. Ask a question Bobby Bobby did. You thank him for his service. For his, his service for the country of diplomacy. 

Speaker 3 

Oh. 

Speaker 2 

Well, I said I I said I said, God bless you, Dennis. I mean, I think it was implied it was implied, but but I should, I should have been more explicit. Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Trying to keep the peace. OK, it was implied. I got you got you. OK. All right. So. So did Dennis have? Did he did. He was his hair colored? I can't remember. 

Speaker 2 

No, I don't think his hair was. No, they they're. 

Speaker 1 

The one of the guys in his. Entourage had blue hair. Yeah. 

Speaker 9 

Blue. Blue hair, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

He had a he had a purple hat on that I can't repeat. What it said on the hat, but you know you can always, you can always imagine the types of things that might be on Dennis Hardman's hat, but I. 

Speaker 9 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Do have the soda so. 

Speaker 1 

That that, that was amazing. That was amazing. It was you. You walk in and look. There's Dennis Rodman only in Chicago. 

Speaker 4 

Oh my gosh. 

Speaker 2 

Maybe we can post a photo on the blog, maybe blur out? 

Speaker 1 

Parts of the photo. Yeah, maybe we can blur. Out the hat and you know, and we'll put it on, we'll put it on the blog. Yeah, I mean, like, you know, you come up here to see. I just came in to get some lunch and I got a site helping. 

Speaker 3 

Wow. 

Speaker 

Of. 

Speaker 1 

Dennis Rodman? Yeah. 

Speaker 4 

Oh my gosh. 

Speaker 1 

So and he got to take a. Picture with him. 

Speaker 2 

I got my. Photo. 

Speaker 1 

Well, that's amazing. Now go ahead. 

Speaker 4 

Sir, it's it's. It's amazing that you guys saw him in person. I mean, I I I feel like I've only seen my TV and. Yeah, you know, it's like from what I from what I saw in you know, in the documentary, we were just talking about, he's he's pretty eccentric and yeah, yeah. It's like, yeah, I I don't know. At least at that time. I think he's having. 

Speaker 1 

Yes, he is. That's understood. 

Speaker 4 

Some like struggles with alcohol and things like that, and and sometimes and and then I remember he was doing a was doing his CNN interview with the No actually actually I think it. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Connie Chung. 

Speaker 9 

Citizen. 

Speaker 4 

Was actually I think I. Think it was Chris Cuomo. 

Speaker 1 

OK, OK, OK. OK. 

Speaker 7 

It's like I don't know. 

Speaker 4 

And it's like at one point, you know, I guess, you know, Chris Cuomo might have asked a question about politics and that that wasn't, that wasn't really on the agenda. So then. You know Dennis got upset and. 

Speaker 1 

I say that and the whole thing, yeah. 

Speaker 4 

But he he finished it off. Well, it is like one day one day this door is going to open, you know, the door between the US and North Korea. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, it's got, it's got a few more. Yeah, it's not opening anytime soon. I think that. 

Speaker 4 

I love. I love to talk to him about his diplomacy with public service sometimes. 

Speaker 1 

Oh, I. Basketball diplomacy. Yes. You know, I would love. I would love to hear more about I saw today. Was the Green River? Yeah, the the Chicago River is green. It's even St. Patricks day. 

Speaker 4 

Yes, it is green. It's Saint Patrick. Well, I I mean I I guess it's not, you know, it's not officially Saint Patrick's Day or it's not Saint Patrick's Day, but you know, like, yeah, like like, like father, like Father Michael. Old Saint Pat said the. There there are 8 days of Saint Patrick's Day, just like there are. 8 days of. 

Speaker 1 

This river is green. Bobby, is it? It is green. 

Speaker 4 

Definitely. 

Speaker 2 

This is my first time. Seeing in person you know something I've known about for most of my life that Chicago, that's the Green River. But it is vibrantly green. 

Speaker 1 

Like your shirt, like you're wearing the Notre Dame Green. It is green and I'm afraid I want to stick my hand in and I'm afraid I'm going to get. 

Speaker 2 

Kelly, the Kelly green shirt on. Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Last time I smoked a Dutch master cigar, I lost the ability to taste for a day and my fingernails were stained for three months. You know, I'm just afraid of sick right hand in that water and it's going to. I'll be like the Joker or something, you know, it looks it is. So it looked right out of Batman, you know, like something. But how did he get? 

Speaker 3 

Ohh. So yeah. 

Speaker 1 

That river so green. 

Speaker 4 

I I don't know, but I think it's some kind of die like like someone was saying the other day it might. 

Speaker 1 

Mean. What are they dumping there? Hmm. 

Speaker 4 

Could be a. It might be a food dye and some people say, oh, it's just dying. You know it's not. A big deal, but. 

Speaker 1 

All natural, of course eco friendly. 

Speaker 4 

It might, yeah. It might not be the best thing for the environment, for the river. 

Speaker 1 

Hey, I hear the fish love it. Yeah, like I'd be eating fish out. 

Speaker 2 

Of Chicago. But it's got to be a lot of die, right? 

Speaker 1 

Her know? 

Speaker 4 

Yeah, there's a lot of time, yes, and. 

Speaker 2 

It would be interesting to we need and this is where we need the statistician again, father off. We need statistician to be looking up. How much? 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, we, we do. Oh. 

Speaker 4 

Diet is. Ohh yeah, I mean, it's probably a lot. And I mean this year I think it's. Even more than usual. Because you know the the, you know the dye goes out further than than it. Used to previous year. Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

What do you mean? I mean they they. Died more of the river. Than ever before. 

Speaker 4 

I yeah, I guess so. I mean the, you know like like the green dye goes farther out. 

Speaker 11 

Oh, I see. 

Speaker 1 

Goes. 

Speaker 4 

Then then, then it used to. Yeah. OK. 

Speaker 1 

Well, I what does it does, it does, I guess does the. Green River go out. Into Lake MI now guess. 

Speaker 4 

I I don't think so. I think I think it goes farther out that way. Yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Approval. Oh, they got the road goes. The other way. OK, well, all I know. Is that it was bright green. It looked pretty. I took a lot of photos and I even. Made it like a like. A shot where I was like drinking the water, you know, like Hiawatha, you. Know. 

Speaker 3 

Oh. 

Speaker 1 

Handle lakes. You know, having a a bit of the a bit of the green water. But so far my hands haven't been staked and and I I didn't. 

Speaker 3 

Oh. 

Speaker 1 

Taste any food. Relative. 

Speaker 2 

So so this is just in ohh from from Google. 

Speaker 12 

Other. 

Speaker 2 

This says 100 lbs of environmentally friendly guy. This is the 6160 first anniversary of this unique event 100 lbs. I mean, it's weird that they measure it in weight and not in. I'm I'm I'm looking for the volume measure. Yeah.

Speaker 4 

Oh my gosh. 

Speaker 1 

You know, I I. Don't know. I feel like people can look and see me. 

Speaker 4 

Well, yeah, I mean. 

Speaker 1 

You're kind of like on display. 

Speaker 2 

Well, when the city father off from CNBC. 

Speaker 3 

Oh my God. Oh. 

Speaker 4 

You know, it's like in in the city you can see in the people's apartments, I mean. Right. I you know, I see a bunch of apartments over there. For example, I can see right then. I mean, you know, seems like there's nobody in there, but yeah, it's doing something. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Someone's doing laundry over there, you know? Yeah. Someone's doing something. You know? I don't know. I mean, like, I don't. 

Speaker 2 

I don't know if I want to be on display right? Well, right now people are looking in this apartment thinking this must be one of the. 

Speaker 4 

Right. 

Speaker 2 

Highest grossing podcasts. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Chris and his family have provided us with. Nice. To to to record, to record from and you know how many young men can just the 3:00 on Tuesday after me and be recording this podcast. Jealous of whatever is going on. 

Speaker 3 

Well. 

Speaker 1 

With folks you know, like you said, we need a statistician. Say what we're doing the podcast and get everyone lined up. And so we have a star-studded lineup of people come. And maybe the people were the other apartment saw me texting all morning here. You know. What's he texting? Who's he texting? Yeah, well, wouldn't you like? To know and. Let's see how we'll see how it all goes. But you got some really nice views. I see we're over the the flight plan of O'Hare there. They're flying right down. The planes are going through and all that. 

Speaker 3 

Ohh wow. We're surrounded by art from Rwanda, yeah? 

Speaker 1 

Stuff. Yeah, Rwandan art. I knew I liked art. I didn't know. I like Rwanda. 

Speaker 2 

It's very colorful, very vibrant painting. 

Speaker 1 

You know, I'm. I'm looking down here at the window. And there's a building going. And there's a big crane. You can see the workers all around. You can see some of the the the sparks or whatever they're doing with welding and stuff. Chris, one thing that I'm surprised by, you know, we have these windows, we would open them up. But you know, it's a little cold here today. We can hear the noise of the city. 

Speaker 4 

Oh yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

But once you. Can hear the sirens. You get, you get. Used to it, you know the sirens. You know the noises of the city. Does it ever wake you up or keep you up at night? 

Speaker 4 

Yeah. 

Speaker 

You have my. 

Speaker 4 

Usually I think, yeah, I feel like I'm, you know, I I feel like I'm used to it. So, you know, I might be desensitized, but it's like, yeah, yeah, I love it. You know, it's like, yeah, it's like I was, you know, I I was. I was doing this meditation. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

I got used to it. New York, you know. 

Speaker 4 

There on the call map and at one point you know, it's like, you know, at at one point we we we took some time and just listen to the sounds focus on the sounds around this. So I think I heard sirens and wind and like. 

Speaker 9 

Alright. 

Speaker 4 

You know, like my, my, my dad on the zoom meeting and all kinds of stuff and. 

Speaker 13 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

You're used to it. No, Bobby, were you were you used to? It in New York, I was. 

Speaker 2 

I was. I mean, even the rats. Even even the rats you know, it's. Yeah, it's exciting. You know, you're living in the concrete jungle. 

Speaker 3 

When you're in new. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. You have all kinds of. 

Speaker 1 

Wildlife. You have wildlife and smells. You know, the one thing I could never get used to was New York City in the summer time. Now you New York in the springtime is fine because it doesn't smell like one big year. 

Speaker 3 

Oh. 

Speaker 2 

Come on. 

Speaker 1 

And the summertime. And it smells. Bobby and I, you walk by and there's rancid milk and and on the garbage on the streets. I don't understand. There. You don't get that here in the Midwest. I really say that's the one thing. That's the one thing the Midwest has got our new. 

Speaker 7 

The. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, they. 

Speaker 4 

That's because we have alleys. 

Speaker 1 

The trash. We got a handle. 

Speaker 3 

Done. 

Speaker 2 

On the trash, the trash well. 

Speaker 1 

You know, yeah. You gotta walk over the rivers or sleeping out of these bags, you know? Don't get your shoe in that you don't. Know what's in there? Yeah, and that's. 

Speaker 3 

Well. 

Speaker 2 

One thing in fairness, right, when you when you don't produce. Much you have little black. So you know in in Europe, you know, we tend to produce more and so they. 

Speaker 1 

Bobby and that you're really trying. He's trying. We're going to get. I'm going to get probably give him a B plus on that one. He's. No, we just we just we're fine. We got better in living in Chicago was one of those those great cities that, you know got to have it restart after the great. You know, Chicago and Saint Louis were in competition with each other. Chicago had a big fire and they thought Saint Louis was like, oh, we're going to be the best city. Actually, no. Chicago came back and they. 

Speaker 4 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Implemented the grid system. 

Speaker 4 

Oh yeah. 

Speaker 1 

And that was they had city planning and. We actually. Pay it off. You know, we got alleys, you know, that was. Didn't someone say this? We got alleys, you know, take the trash. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, it's true. It's true. Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

In the alley. You know, not the front, not the front page. So anyway, but you know each to. Each their own. 

Speaker 3 

Yes, yes. 

Speaker 1 

Each city has its pluses and minuses, you know? And and Chicago's got this great pluses. And I would say the Chicago alley. 

Speaker 14 

Is, is, is, is, is is a. 

Speaker 1 

A real treasure. That's where the trash goes. Bobby. Yes, and that's. 

Speaker 

And then. 

Speaker 2 

Goes in. 

Speaker 1 

Where the rats are, they're not on the street. Walking with you or competing for space. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Who? Who was it? Who was it? Who was just arguing with yesterday about what city had? 

Speaker 3 

The bigger rats. 

Speaker 1 

I think it was, doctor, Doctor Mike Burton and his fiancee, Sam. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, they were trying to. They were trying to argue that Chicago and bigger rats than New York did not know that. And it's like and, you know, I I think I heard on. 

Speaker 4 

Oh my God. Whoa. The The Daily Show. Something like that the other night. That you know, you know, New York City rats were found to carry COVID, so watch out. 

Speaker 14 

That was it. 

Speaker 4 

Like, Oh my gosh, you know, it's like, I don't know, that might not be the worst thing that rats are carrying, but. 

Speaker 1

Speaker 1 

I'm holding on. So so Pat, I hear that you recently had another. Dial. 

Speaker 5 

Indeed. Wyatt Wyatt Doyle was born October 18th, 2022, and he he made a very dramatic arrival here in Chicago and. 

Speaker 1 

Well, I mean, I mean sorry, let's right click on that. Let's see. Yeah, double click. Let's double click. Sorry. Double click. That's what all the kids are saying. Let's double click click. So tell us, what is this? What is this? This big fan dangled entrance. I mean, every baby has a big entrance. Every baby has an entrance. 

Speaker 5 

Sure. And it's it's always exciting. Wyatt was an accidental at home delivery. Yes. Yes. His cousin Jack goes to tell him that he was born next to a toilet. 

Speaker 1 

Ohh. There's a very nice. 

Speaker 5 

It was in good shape but but but he was indeed going next to a toilet. So you know, he's got a he's got an interesting story. He can't tell it yet, but but I'm happy. To tell it on on his. 

Speaker 15 

Yeah. OK. If you don't mind, can. 

Speaker 1 

You share this. Story I would love to hear more. I mean, how? Many times have you heard of of? A baby being born at home, you don't? Not much. No, no. You. 

Speaker 5 

It's not a common occurrence and it was not our plan, but my wife was, you know, obviously we were ready for the baby to come and. She called me at the office, said it's it's time to come home. We're going to go to the hospital pretty soon and some things are. So I'm working downtown. I get on the Li, get back to our neighborhood and I I really quickly went to CVS to get some. Snacks and drinks because. We were going to go to the hospital for several days and I didn't want to be. Depending on cafeteria food, so first. You get the snacks and then I come home and. 

Speaker 1 

Little Smokies, slim jims. 

Speaker 5 

Yeah, I got a nice collection of snacks I was really proud of myself. I I came home and it was very. Intense feminine energy in the room. My wife was there with with her mother and she had been working with a a duo or like. A birth coach. And and and and we decided right away. Let's let's get going to the hospital. And so I started taking some bags to the hospital. I'm sorry, bags. To the car, the. Snacks, snacks to the car, duffel bags to the car, change of clothes, fresh socks. Which is important. These are things I didn't have the first time around. Snacks. And and socks. 

Speaker 1 

I can interrupt you, I mean. What are your wife think when you said, hey, honey, I got the snacks. Baby is coming. But don't worry, honey. I got the snacks. I got I got. I don't talk about. 

Speaker 11 

Sweet target. 

Speaker 5 

The snacks until afterwards, so it's very exciting. Two indulgent snacks. When I came in the door, I immediately recognized it like I should not be talking about. 

Speaker 9 

My snacks, but yeah, I'm loading up the car. 

Speaker 5 

And then my wife steps into the the bathroom and and asks for Samantha, who was the the doula we've been working with her and kind of helping her prepare for a a birth without epidural. She, she says. Samantha, can you come back here and? And Samantha, just? Call us anything says OK, we're we're not going to make it to the hospital. We're going to have this baby right here, so. 

Speaker 1 

Oh my gosh. Wow. 

Speaker 5 

Yeah. Patrick, I need you to call 911 and I need you to bring me gloves and towels if you have. And my mother-in-law was there, and she and I shared shared this experience the, the, the, the look of bewilderment. When I learned this. So not much to say there and I just had to do as I was told. So call 911 and told the the people on the phone, you know, my wife's having a baby. You need to get here right away and and the dispatcher is trying to figure out if I'm pulling her leg and she's like, oh, it's, you know, it's is the baby coming now and I'm screaming out of, like, the baby's coming. This is why I'm calling. I don't why you need. To get the ambulance over here immediately. And and the duo says yes, she's she's crowning now. So tell him to hurry up. So I said that, you know, to the to the dispatcher she. Said they're. On her way and. It it was. Just a few minutes after that, I'm pacing the hallway with my mother-in-law, and my wife is in the. Bathroom with with. The doula and and next thing you know, they say Patrick, come on in and and and meet your son and went in there and there was he was he was. Kind of still and quiet so that she kind of tickled him and and pinched him a little bit. He started crying and he was healthy and and breathing just fine and. A couple minutes. Later the the paramedics showed up and the hard part was over, so they just kind of had to to transport mom and baby to the hospital, but yeah. 

Speaker 2 

That's amazing. 

Speaker 5 

Well. 

Speaker 12 

I I don't I. 

Speaker 1 

Don't smoke. I think I need. 

Speaker 5 

A cigarette apple lose a lot. I lose a lot. But you know, my wife also had a big day that day. It was big for me, but also for her. 

Speaker 9 

Ah. 

Speaker 3 

Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, I remember. So I was looking back because it was it was October 18th when Pat sent the message to our group. 

Speaker 4 

MHM. 

Speaker 2 

With the picture of Wyatt saying happy birthday to what happy birthday to Wyatt Joseph Doyle, born today in an accidental home birth in our bathroom dot dot dot. All very excited. 

Speaker 1 

I've never. Have you seen anything born? I haven't seen anything. Morning, Chris. Have you? I've even seen, like, a dog or a cat. 

Speaker 2 

Well, I've seen puppies born because my dad's been, so I've been there. Yeah, kittens and puppy. 

Speaker 1 

Well, yeah, that's fair. Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, but so you know, but this is, This is why we need to bring the show on the road more. 

Speaker 5 

I haven't seen anything. Wow. 

Speaker 9 

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wow. 

Speaker 2 

Only by bringing. The show on the road, are we able to hear stories like this, you know, from the field, so to speak? 

Speaker 11 

Yeah. Good morning, good morning. But I can't. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. Yeah. Oh my gosh. 

Speaker 5 

Keep up with Dennis Rodman. I'm sure he had some. 

Speaker 1 

This is no, it was stop. He was not. He was not. But I got to ask now how is? Lucy, your daughter, who is the older your first child? How does she dealing with Wyatt? Like? How did you know? 

Speaker 5 

Yeah. 

Speaker 6 

Was she there too? 

Speaker 5 

She was not there, thankfully. She was. She was in daycare and we we have a a dog, a family dog who was sequestered in a in another room. 

Speaker 15 

OK, sure with that, OK. 

Speaker 9 

Yeah. 

Speaker 5 

So it's to not trip up the paramedics. And get in the way but. 

Speaker 9 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Lucy is doing well with life's good playmate. 

Speaker 5 

Lucy. Lucy's been doing a great job. You know, she she's very stern with Wyatt when he sucks his thumb. She tells him not to do that and but she shares toys. Yes, she shares her toys and. 

Speaker 1 

Oh oh, she shared stories. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. 

Speaker 6 

She gets a lot of hugs. 

Speaker 5 

A lot of hugs and and some tickling and some bouncing and rocking. So yeah, she's she's 2 1/2. 

Speaker 1 

Tickling. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. 

Speaker 5 

She's got that toddler. Rambunctious energy. Ohh yeah. Sounds a fun big Notre Dame football. 

Speaker 9 

Fan. Well, you know what? 

Speaker 1 

What, what else can you ask for? 

Speaker 3 

Ohh, raising them low. 

Speaker 1 

Raising of oil, raising of oil. So now. Well, we thank you for coming by because we know you got to. Get back to. Work, you know, and this this special edition of. 

Speaker 5 

I do. 

Speaker 1 

The podcast on the road. 

Speaker 2 

I know he's got two kids to support now, so he's got he's got, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Here in Chicago. 

Speaker 9 

He's got to get back to work. Yeah, maybe needs a new pair of shoes. 

Speaker 1 

Well, thank you for. 

Speaker 5 

Great to see you guys. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Thanks for calling. 

Speaker 1 

OK. Well, our first guest surprisingly is not here in Chicago. He's actually tuning in all the way from Duke University down there in North Carolina. We have Patrick Sansone. 

Speaker 14 

Hello everyone it is. Great to be on. Thank you. So. 

Speaker 1 

Much for having Ohh Patrick, it's. Good to hear. Your voice is it? Is it warmer there than it? Is here. It's only like like 31 today. 

Speaker 10 

Yeah, it's about 50 down here. So it's not too bad, but I've gotten soft since moving from the Midwest. And this is still cold for me. 

Speaker 1 

I bet it is, I bet. It is now, Patrick. Someone was telling me you are going to be climbing Kilimanjaro. 

Speaker 10 

Yes, that you are absolutely correct. So I will be climbing Kilimanjaro immediately after I graduate at the very end of May. OK, wait. 

Speaker 2 

That's pretty cool. How'd you line that up? 

Speaker 10 

Yeah. So one of my former mentors or current mentors makes me up with this program and it has huge significance for me, basically the organization I'm going through is called radiating hope, and their mission is to provide cancer care to underserved areas. Of the world. Globally and they do this through these fundraising climbs. And so I thought, man, this is the perfect time, right? Between when I graduate, grad school and before I started new job. I'm not gonna get in another window of time like this. And I just gotta just. Gotta do it, you know. 

Speaker 1 

Well. Let me ask. Sir, wait. You're graduating? What are you graduating from Graduate School? What were you studying? 

Speaker 10 

Yeah. So I ended my last semester getting my masters in medical physics. 

Speaker 1 

OK. Is that what is that what? Is that what, like Doctor McCoy did on the? 

Speaker 16 

Enterprise. 

Speaker 1 

Medical physics. I mean, what what is medical physics? 

Speaker 9 

I. 

Speaker 10 

It it, it might as well be. Yeah, it it might. 

Speaker 3 

So. 

Speaker 1 

Beat me up now. Is that what? 

Speaker 3 

You beat me up. 

Speaker 10 

Yeah. Beam me up, Scotty. Exactly. Medical physics is the branch of physics that is used in medicine, literally medical physics. So, for example, there's like two sides of this deal that any of you have ever broken bone. And you've gotten like an X-ray or a CT or MRI. We. Part of the people were responsible for that radiation. That those machines use. That's one side the other side. 

Speaker 3 

OK. 

Speaker 10 

The other side is basically, if you unfortunately know anyone who's ever undergone cancer radiation therapy, we are responsible for the radiation that is produced by those machines and we make sure it comes out of the machine the way we want so that it goes into the patient and kills the tumor cells. The way that we want it to. 

Speaker 3 

Oh wow, that's really good. 

Speaker 6 

Wow, cool. But you gotta. 

Speaker 1 

You gotta be very precise and right. 

Speaker 5 

On the money. 

Speaker 10 

Oh my gosh, absolutely. It is really hard to hit a tumor inside the body. 

Speaker 1 

Wow, I mean. 

Speaker 8 

I mean. 

Speaker 2 

Wow. That's so are you sorry if I missed this already. Are you pursuing MD or is this a mass a different type of masters? What is? What's the degree? 

Speaker 10 

Yeah. Yeah. So it's a masters degree, but I will be working in a hospital setting. So just. Yeah. Yeah. So that's why I have to still do a residency. It's not as long as an empty residency, but. 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 10 

It'd be about. Two years. So two year Masters, two year residency and then I will work in a hospital and. Yeah, this this feels really niche. So a lot of people haven't heard about it. Just to kind of put it into perspective, they're about a million empty positions in the United States, but there's only over a little over 10,000 practicing medical physicists in the United States cause usually. It's like 1 per hospital or two per hospital. 

Speaker 2 

Wow. Wow, that's a a white company. 

Speaker 1 

That is and. And and how is it? How is this connected to Kilimanjaro? You're climbing this? There's a connection here. You were saying? 

Speaker 10 

There's absolutely there's absolutely connections, so I mean. I mean, personally I know people and I've had, you know, friends, you know, family, friends who have been affected by cancer. But part of what I'm trying to do is raise money for Tanzania specifically to purchase the various same treatment equipment, these radiation producing machines that I hope to use in my own career. And part of my long term. Goal is to provide education and training. To develop the country. Trees for how to use this equipment. Once I gain that clinical knowledge myself. 

Speaker 1 

Wow. Wow. And so this group is going to go to Tanzania, and how long is it going to take? You to climb you. Know are, are, are you doing some strenuous routine of preparing yourself to do this big hike, this big walkabout. 

Speaker 10 

Yes. So until about this big walk about, yeah, until about like about a month ago I had, I was never really a runner. I never got into running. I I pretty much stuck with the weights, but now I really need to get my running legs under me, so I've been doing that a few times a week. 

Speaker 1 

Wow. 

Speaker 10 

There. Yeah. Your question as far as how long it takes to. Get up. Our group is large and, like me, inexperienced at high altitudes, so it's going to take about 5 days to get up fast. Experienced climbers can do it in two. 

Speaker 8 

Wow. 

Speaker 7 

Oh well, you. 

Speaker 1 

Know why rush where you can take your time to smell the roses and have a. 

Speaker 10 

Well, yeah, exactly. 

Speaker 1 

Cup of tea or glass of cheese. Maybe go on safari up there? Yeah, while you're up there, we'll do. Wild animal. Are you scared of wild animals? 

Speaker 10 

I luckily, the higher you get up, the fewer animals there are. I'm I'm not really worried about too much at 19,000 feet, but definitely in the lowlands for sure. I will. I will definitely be watching my back. I I I will. I'm going to position myself in, in the middle of the. So that I'm not at the front. Or the back. 

Speaker 1 

OK. Well, I'm just going to tell you right now. I saw some YouTube. Shorts about hyenas. Stay away from the hyenas. They're just brutal. 

Speaker 10 

OK, well this is the problem is that they can. I will do my best to stay away from. Them, but they can hide pretty well, can't they? 

Speaker 1 

I assume I think they all can and they oh. Oh my gosh. So. So how many people are going to go up this mountain with you? 

Speaker 10 

With with me, I think our group is about. 18 to 20. 

Speaker 13 

OK. 

Speaker 1 

And hopefully, as a doctor with you. 

Speaker 10 

Yes, OK, great. Alright, great. 

Speaker 1 

Just in case you never know, in case you're. 

Speaker 10 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Ready to know hyena? It needs some medical. 

Speaker 10 

Attention and I can get on my way. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. Chris, have you ever climbed a mountain? 

Speaker 4 

Oh, no, I, I I don't think so, but I've I I have hiked before. I mean, I remember about four years ago when. Yeah, I was in. I I was in agreement with my mom and my dad. And then, you know, like some friends, some of my dad's Co workers. We. Yeah, we we did some we we did some hiking through like I don't know if they're I don't know if there were mountains they they might have been more like hills and it was a a relatively straightforward hike but I think the next day you know. 

Speaker 7 

OK. 

Speaker 4 

My my dad and some, you know, my dad and the others. The you know, they did a really intense hike and and you know, thankfully I, you know, I my mom and I just went to the museum. 

Speaker 3 

Well. 

Speaker 1 

Bobby, have you tried? 

Speaker 2 

I mean, I've done. I've done some hiking too. I just recently climbed Pikes Peak. Right, which is a decent a fourteener. And that's from from the start of the height to the top. I mean you you gain. 

Speaker 5 

Ohh yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Hey, this is Jason. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

7500 feet. In one day, you know, and that's about 12. I think it's about, I forget, was about 12 hours hiking. Whatever it was, it was good. 

Speaker 10 

Yeah, yeah. I I I think it's gorgeous. I remember driving up to the top of the gift shop and watching you. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

But yeah, yeah. Yeah. You just. Yeah. Yeah, you just. Said the worst thing about it, Patrick, is that at the top of it is a gift. Store at. A donut shop? You know, it's like you climb up. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

There, you're half out. Of breath. Literally because it's, you know, you're above the tree line and the air is. And and then there's just people, you know, snacking on. Doughnuts, like looking like what's your? Oh my God. So. But I'm not trying. To take away from you. But because I did the same thing you did, I climbed Pikes Peak too. But you know one pipe 1 mount. I'd love to climb. Is Mount Fuji? 

Speaker 9 

Yeah, yeah. Beautiful. 

Speaker 10 

My parents did. 

Speaker 6 

You know what? Maybe I need to talk with them. 

Speaker 1 

I want to climb Mount Fuji. You know, usually I always go to Mount Fuji restaurant. 

Speaker 10 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

For my Japanese food, but I want to climb Fuji, so I anyway. Well, when you get back, we're going to have to trade some stories here because I want to hear the ends and outs and climbing up a mountain so that when I climb Fuji or I get helicopter up there and dropped up there, you know, then I know what to look out for, what they going to do. Right. 

Speaker 3 

Which? 

Speaker 10 

Absolutely. Be careful with the helicopter though. Yeah, because that elevation change might be you might not be acclimatized to it, that could be. Dangerous if you're not careful. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, you know, I'm. Getting older here, you know, I'm getting old all of. It. Well, we wish you all the. Rest and good luck. We'll hear more about your trip through the blog so our visitors can take a look at the blog coming up and hear and see all about what's going on with your trip to Kilimanjaro. Well, thank you. Thank you for. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. 

Speaker 9 

Wonderful. 

Speaker 1 

Joining us. Thank you. 

Speaker 2 

Patrick, you. 

Speaker 10 

Thank you so much. For having me. On. 

Speaker 2 

Patrick, thank you for your very rare service to to the medical industry. 

Speaker 1 

Guys, don't you like that, Patrick? 

Speaker 2 

Fantastic. And you know what? A fascinating field. You have. Medical, physics, physics, medical, physics. 

Speaker 4 

And medical physics, yeah. 

Speaker 9 

Yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 6 

I guess those machines. 

Speaker 1 

Have. You know, technicians that make them work, and he's the one who makes them give the radiation work. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. And it's clearly his vision of, you know, going, going to the developing world and. And you know, training, you know, training others to do the same was pretty pretty cool vision for young man. 

Speaker 1 

And he's also brave. I mean, I'm not sure if I would climb up Kilimanjaro, you know, after I saw all those YouTube shorts. I I don't want to. There's too many wild animals in Africa. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, but here's that strategy. 

Speaker 2 

Of playing in the middle of the pack so. He's not the one that gets taken down so that that made me question his character a little bit. Otherwise seems like a great guy. 

Speaker 1 

Yes, I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure. Well, talk about another great guy. We have another great guest here with us. Came all the way from Chicago. Patty fox. Patty, welcome. Former AR. Now working down. Here in Chicago. 

Speaker 13 

Great. 

Speaker 1 

Well, thank you so much for showing. 

Speaker 8 

Yeah, well, I heard through cattails, so. 

Speaker 9 

Oh. 

Speaker 1 

Anyway so anyway. I was gonna say. Today, isn't that a beautiful day today? Yesterday was such a crummy day. Today's a great day. Sun's. Out great day to do a podcast. 

Speaker 13 

Yeah, it's almost above freezing. 

Speaker 1 

Now I don't know if you know this, but we saw well, Bobby spotted Dennis Rodman at. Lunch. 

Speaker 11 

He and I look a lot alike, so maybe it costs a little bit of a little bit of. 

Speaker 2 

Now our celebrity sighting is common in Chicago. Do you spot celebrities here? 

Speaker 13 

You know, I'm not the burbs guy. Yeah, so you know, the only celebrities of my dog, you know my wife, but yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Are you on the birds? OK. Well, your wife? Yeah, that's that's a good stuff. 

Speaker 11 

Yeah, I think they're I think they're. 

Speaker 13 

Very common. 

Speaker 2 

But surely you come out for dinner and you know you know. 

Speaker 5 

Here's Big city. 

Speaker 8 

Yeah, you know where we're going to see Dennis. 

Speaker 2 

Yes. 

Speaker 13 

Dennis. Lunch. It's pretty good. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Are you from Chicago originally? Are you from? 

Speaker 13 

I'm from great state of Virginia, just getting used to the, you know mid spring 30° weather. 

Speaker 2 

Oh, Virginia, that's right. 

Speaker 1 

Bobby, you know U of a UVA. 

Speaker 13 

Yeah, those are two different things, Todd. 

Speaker 1 

OK. Sorry, sorry. Doesn't have a. 

Speaker 3 

Campus. That's right. What? 

Speaker 11 

Do they? They don't have grounds grounds. 

Speaker 2 

What the grounds in? You guys are pretty snobby about that too well. 

Speaker 11 

Yeah. Just about your body, but thanks. 

Speaker 2 

Well, it's true. You know, I used to go and interview NBA candidates. At UVA because garden it's a good, good Business School they have there. And every time I make mention of the campus, they would quickly correct me and say, excuse me, the grounds in interviews. 

Speaker 13 

In interviews. Thanks. Yeah, that's not a good. 

Speaker 5 

Look. 

Speaker 2 

I need to see if they could. 

Speaker 1 

I really don't care. 

Speaker 8 

To be honest, you can call campus. 

Speaker 2 

If you want, I'd like to put them on the, you know, put them on their heels in the interview and. See how they responded? So so tell us. 

Speaker 3 

Wow. Wow. 

Speaker 1 

You got you got married? Not so long. Right there, right there at the.

All right. 

Speaker 2 

Wow, what was that sound?

I yeah, I do. 

Speaker 2 

I'm sorry. 

Speaker 13 

You have some Rasta roots. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, I'm sure. Yeah, we do. We all do. I think you know. But I was gonna say that one thing I need is to. I'm glad the sun came out today because it it kind of got a little dark and dank up here. But anyway, well. Anyway, well, it's not even. OK. That we could have a podcast taping. Yeah, we're a little. Cheers here, everyone. You know, like cheers. Clinky clink clanky. 

Speaker 3 

Let's see here. 

Speaker 1 

So. So tell us. How has life been treating you? Patty, you're now in the in the in the work world. Are you trying to clean up the? Mess of SVB bank. 

Speaker 3 

Oh. 

Speaker 13 

I wish I was that. 

Speaker 11 

Important. 

Speaker 13 

You know, it seems like the federal government has done that, done that for us. 

Speaker 11 

The federal government. 

Speaker 1 

Yes, they they ran airlines so well. Let's get them to do banks. 

Speaker 13 

Yeah. So you know the workload is is you know to come to the coast day by day, you know, pumping the clock, OK. 

Speaker 9 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Day by day. Yeah. Yeah, you're just you're. Just one day at a time. This is all opportunities. Keeping your head above water. 

Speaker 13 

New live action little Mermaid's coming out so. 

Speaker 4 

I mean, Oh yeah, I saw the trailer the other night. Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Ohh wow, wow. Yeah, exactly. Well, I tell you, we certainly miss you down. Instead, what do you miss about, you know, Notre Dame? You miss about saying heads? 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 11 

Yeah, I think I. 

Speaker 13 

Missed the physical and metaphorical red room. There's the physical. Aspect of the redness, you know, it's not a lot of red rooms. 

Speaker 

Yes. 

Speaker 13 

There out there. Anymore, you know? But then you don't have the community in there. 

Speaker 2 

Well, so we brought the metaphorical Redmond to Chicago. 

Speaker 6 

Oh. 

Speaker 13 

Missed that? Can't say that. You know I missed the lake effect and don't miss that. North Dining Hall N Hall. Yeah, just the community. You know, I I hear from the guys every now and again they they still send. Me a text. 

Speaker 1 

Asking for bail money too, I'm sure. 

Speaker 2 

How'd you land it? So. So you went UVA, undergrad, and then you came to nothing for your MBA. How did you land at Notre Dame? 

Speaker 13 

I I think a variety of factors. I did it during COVID which is canceled now. So that's that's so with Dori. My wife is Notre Dame law grad. That had a some sort of effect. 

Speaker 2 

So she was already out. 

Speaker 13 

There and then Shane Edwards, that was really. Yeah, that was really the the recruitment tactic, no. She. Was out there, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. No. You know, if I may be. 

Speaker 6 

So bold as. 

Speaker 13 

Sure. Please. 

Speaker 1 

To interject here, you actually told a wonderful story about how you would come as a UVA player, a soccer player, and maybe you cried. 

Speaker 8 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

One of those times too? I don't know. But you came out here with play soccer and you said you told me one time that you said I always want to come to Notre Dame. I want to to be here. 

Speaker 8 

Translate. 

Speaker 1 

And you've got yourself here. Through the the the Graduate School. Yeah. And I was always. I was always, always. I always remember that story. It was very moving and we were just so lucky that. You knew. I think. Pete, Pete McKee. And and and he says, hey, once you. 

Speaker 13 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Think about saying. It and that's how it. All happened and I remember you. Came over for an interview. You didn't even know that we were. You were being interviewed because. You said this isn't an interview and it really wasn't. We just wanted to make sure that we could find a. Good playmate for Nate. That's all we wanted. Talking, that's. Do you play well with Nate? I mean, like, that's all. Needed, you know. Folks and we. Got that? And we got a great answer. The whole now you know. Who was who was the AR? Your senior year. 

Speaker 4 

Oh, senior year. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. Who was the AR trying to think? Who was? Your because you graduated in 2018. OK, I'm. 

Speaker 4 

20. Yes. 

Speaker 1 

I can't remember. I don't remember years anymore, but I I I wonder if it was Frank. Frank Stacey would have been around that time. 

Speaker 8 

See. 

Speaker 4 

Oh yeah, AKA Uncle Frank. 

Speaker 1 

And then I I wonder. If we had Pete at that time. 

Speaker 4 

Yeah. So if we had, Frank, I think he lived in, you know, he lived in, you know, in that room next to 2:19 wasn't the year. 

Speaker 1 

I don't think so. No, it was he would have. Been next year. Yeah. Well, I don't know, but. Ohh Dylan Foy. Dylan Foy, he was Dylan Foy. Dylan, Floyd, Dylan. Floyd was also. The lawyer here in Chicago, we should. 

Speaker 2 

Have called up dill. You man, you could really layer up if you needed to. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. Careful. Don't take me and I'll see you in court. Actually, that's what we're gonna do. We're trying to take over some. We got legal action going on. I got a D and we're going to try to open this up. You know, we want that land back, folks. Skybridge Sky, Sky Bridge. 

Speaker 9 

Ohh. 

Speaker 4 

Ohh Skype. 

Speaker 1 

Bridge. Yes. Now shifting gears here, shifting gears here, now you are. A. A southerner? Yeah. A Southerner through and through I. I've never heard you talk about eating at a Waffle House. Yeah, but I'm sure that they don't. You know, they kind of give out, I think, around somewhere. That chicken. 

Speaker 13 

Yeah. Here, what's this around here? Just got Chick-fil-A. 

Speaker 1 

What? What's something different about living here in the Midwest than living in the South? They talk funny down there, everyone's family. 

Speaker 13 

They did. They talked. They were funny. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's some of that fewer Popeyes. You know more hot dogs? What's something different? Well, it's March, you know, whatever it is mid March now and and still, you know, 30° outside that's different. Yeah, but that's a negative. We gotta focus on the positives. There's a great train system here. Yeah. Chicago. We don't have that in really any southern city. So positive, you know, Midwestern people, they're pretty nice. 

Speaker 1 

Out of positive. 

Speaker 13 

Different kind of nice. OK, you know, let's so, like, like Southern hospitality. Like, let's all you know, hang in my house more so like. You know, smile wave. 

Speaker 8 

Ah. 

Speaker 13 

You know, but it's a. Big City, Chicago's big city.

Point though, actually, because I I'm not here.

To defend Chicago, I really don't care, but. 

Speaker 13 

Chicago has #3 GDP in the. United States. Wow. 

Speaker 4

Speaker 1 

You know, you know what? If we could create a dog, I want to talk to. 

Speaker 6 

You folks, I. 

Speaker 1 

Guess I'm going to tell you a little story. I was thinking we could create a dog. No, I didn't. 

Speaker 2 

Fire wants to be careful. God creates dogs. 

Speaker 1 

Well, damn. What God your God will create the dog. Want to breed a dog? I want to call it a domer doodle. OK. And I want to create, you know, a thing called Puppy Mill pound. And with the pound, it would be like an interlocking ND. 

Speaker 3 

Whoa. 

Speaker 1 

PMP puppy, mill pound and we'll we'll create domer. 

Speaker 

Yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Doodles and I. Don't know. I gotta get a dog.

God. 

Speaker 1 

Who's in? I guess dog husbandry or something? 

Speaker 16 

And figure out like how do. 

Speaker 1 

We pair dogs and. 

Speaker 16 

How do we create this new breed? 

Speaker 8 

We can look anything up on YouTube. 

Speaker 1 

That's right. You know? Yeah. Cut the middle man. Out go right to your head. 

Speaker 2 

Now, do we have any stedmen that are I mean, so my dad's a veterinarian. Do we have any stutsman or my sisters as well? But do we have any Stutzman who are veterinarians? 

Speaker 1 

No, but I do. Know of one guy who's a doctor, a human doctor, and his wife is a veterinarian. 

Speaker 2 

OK, close enough. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. Yeah. And also too, I know of a stessman whose sister is a doc, a veterinary. And the city and the city. And yeah, I should say, New York, that city. Well, whatever the city you it's like the Ohio University. OK. Oh, my gosh. Well, Patty, let me ask what advice we just got done hiring. 

Speaker 10 

You. 

Speaker 2 

Well, the city. 

Speaker 1 

New AR and we're going to have them on the show here soon. What advice would you have for someone who is following in your wake? Our new AR. 

Speaker 13 

I don't know. I should be giving advice. 

Speaker 7 

Well. 

Speaker 8 

First advice I'd give just say you didn't do it. I would say just don't say no. 

Speaker 13 

You know like. Whatever it is, just don't say no. Just say yes, try to try to go to it. Try to do it. Try to. 

Speaker 11 

Be a part. 

Speaker 13 

Of it, you know, because it does go fast. So you know, just don't say no. That was that was a drug campaign. 

Speaker 6 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

So it's just saying that. 

Speaker 1 

Oh my gosh. Well, Patty, it's always good to talk with you. Thank you so much for coming in. We can keep talking here. But you know, we have to move on. There's other people coming in. So if you don't mind, we're gonna ask you to sit on the couch and. Make space for our. Next guest coming on the way. Alright. Thanks, buddy. Guys, don't you like that Patty Foss? 

Speaker 9 

Great guy. 

Speaker 4 

Oh great. 

Speaker 1 

Guy, I guess we should say that he's. 

Speaker 16 

Sitting over there on the. 

Speaker 9 

Couch. He's just move on. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

So no, we love you. We love you. You know, I I knew. Southerners were always nice, but I know they're also talkers, but we have another talker here. We got Brandon Ryan from the class of 2018. 

Speaker 15 

Welcome Brandon. Ohh, and another Southerner actually another people. Forget, but originally from Texas so. 

Speaker 7 

That is true, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Is that the cell? 

Speaker 15 

That is a good point. I guess it depends the lens that you're looking into. Where are. You from Virginia? Virginia. OK. So I feel like that's another sort of edge of the South, but but I think they both probably safely fault. Yeah, they snuck in there. 

Speaker 9 

Ah. 

Speaker 1 

OK, well, I'm not going to. 

Speaker 6 

I'm not going to weigh in on this one. This is, this is Nebraska is going to look exactly. 

Speaker 4 

And I I'm not a Midwesterner too, so I'm not going to weigh in. Yeah. 

Speaker 6 

We're not going, we're going to. Stay. 

Speaker 1 

Up, we're going to stay out of that water. That mess. Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

I'm just gonna stay above. It. 

Speaker 1 

You, he said. 

Speaker 9 

Yeah, he said. Love it. Yeah. 

Speaker 4 

Good idea. 

Speaker 1 

Let me ask you know, today we're here, the big smoking, you just never know what is going. Happened. You know, yesterday all of a sudden. When Bobby, you. 

Speaker 6 

Know we also in the snowstorm blew in and it blew out. You know, the sun. 

Speaker 1 

Is out today. 

Speaker 4 

Spring break. 

Speaker 1 

Spring break now. Now, yeah. Over spring break. Yes, Chris. Now we ran into none other than than than Bobby. 

Speaker 10 

We ran into. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, at lunch, we ran to Dennis Rodman. Well, that happened. Wow. OK. Oh my God. 

Speaker 1 

Today, today, and I was going to say, let's sit at the bar and thank God we didn't because I didn't. Want to be no? Oh, God. Oh, wait a minute. A bunch of people like you. Can we take photos? And we would have to be taking the photos because he doesn't do selfies. 

Speaker 4 

Well, yeah. Why doesn't he do selfie? 

Speaker 8 

So we have. 

Speaker 1 

To be doing the photos I. 

Speaker 6 

Don't know some of his publicist. 

Speaker 2 

It's not. It's not a flattering image. Yeah, but. 

Speaker 3 

Well. 

Speaker 9 

We want to ask you, Brandon. 

Speaker 6 

You know, you live here in the big smoke, have you? 

Speaker 1 

Run into anyone famous. 

Speaker 15 

I don't think I really have. I was just telling telling a patio over here. In about the course of a month, I ran onto. I ran into two different bravo stars, like Bravo TV reality stars who I don't really follow too much, but I think it was 2 bachelors in a row I ran into in wrestle and I made awkward eye contact as I was like. I think I know you from. 

Speaker 4 

Ohh. 

Speaker 7 

But I don't know quite what and there was a bit of. 

Speaker 15 

A stare down. And then and then we went on our way and that was pretty much. It so. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Well, there there are no women. So. 

Speaker 15 

One of them successfully was a bachelor and had his Bachelorette or now wife, I guess, and the other one was with many women, so he was less successful of the bachelor. Yes, exactly. Exactly. So it's definitely two different end results of that show. 

Speaker 3 

Wow. 

Speaker 6 

So he still had a he still had. 

Speaker 1 

To give away. Now tell me, since you've you've been living here in Chicago. Where else have you lived? You've. I know you've. Kind of moved around a bit, yeah. 

Speaker 15 

So yeah, my first year in outside of college, I moved around with the company a little bit, went basically back and forth between New York and Saint Louis. Yeah, I thought just randomly kept going back and forth between those two. Well, cities and states, I guess, yeah. And then finally landed in Saint Louis for three years before moving here in 2021 officially. So. Yeah, just been hanging out in Midwest. 

Speaker 6 

Saint Louis. 

Speaker 2 

What's the company? 

Speaker 15 

I work for Anheuser-Busch. Wonderful, yes. Wow. Of a claim. 

Speaker 8 

But we're going to have. 

Speaker 6 

That, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yes. Why? Why do you why? Just open at the end. 

Speaker 1 

That is a fairpoint this. 

Speaker 15 

Well, you know, Father, help isn't isn't quite a. 

Speaker 4 

We are in this thing. 

Speaker 1 

Well, I could be one today. It got warm. I mean that the sun coming through those windows. It was cooking. They got some champagne. Now let me ask you work for Anheuser Busch now. 

Speaker 15 

I'll tell you what. Down and get something real quick but. 

Speaker 1 

Yes, when you were. In Saint Louis, did you see the Clydesdales? 

Speaker 7 

Of course. 

Speaker 1 

The the big horses, the the. 

Speaker 17 

Uh. 

Speaker 15 

The Clydesdale stable is the only original part of the Bush estate that remains on the headquarter campus, so the original stables are there, and they bring the Clydesdales back for tours every single day. Wow. Yeah. So you can just go down and see them now all the. 

Speaker 1 

Time. Now you're among friends. I'm gonna ask this question, but like when you look to meetings at work, you know, do they open up like here have a bud? Light. 

Speaker 15 

You're not every meeting. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

You have a little, you know, like it was around. The table conference, you know? Like I have a little bud light, you know. 

Speaker 15 

No, but I will say it actually has a very, I would say like. Healthy comfort level with alcohol at work, so it's it's what we do. It's what people sort of align themselves with, even if they don't particularly drink our products or drink at all. I certainly know a handful of people at work who do not drink. But in Saint Louis in particular, like it is a cultural icon. Yeah, it's the the brand and and the company of the town. So people are very proud to work for it. But now that I work at the Goose Island Brewery, it's it's maybe less that and more that people are. Disciples of Like Craft brewing like people love the art of brewing and certainly being able to go to the tap room and have your last meeting of the day or have you know, meet with your coworkers afterward over a beer is a cool benefit. That people do take part in, but definitely not flowing all day. 

Speaker 1 

Guy. 

Speaker 3 

Wow. 

Speaker 2 

What's? What's your job for, Anheuser-Busch? 

Speaker 15 

I do sales operations for the craft and Imports division, so I specifically work with our craft breweries like Goose Island in Chicago as well as most notably Stella Artois and Kona Big Wave for larger imports brands. 

Speaker 

Yes. 

Speaker 2 

Do you guys still get the benefit? 

Speaker 11 

So. 

Speaker 2 

Of. Like $50.00 a month or. 

Speaker 15 

Something that is exactly what it is. Yeah, that's that is exactly what my benefit is. Is it's $50. It's that's a month. 

Speaker 2 

Dinner. 

Speaker 15 

For our listeners, yeah, exactly. So it's actually part of my. Paycheck like taxed as part of my bank. 

Speaker 1 

Oh. God. 

Speaker 15 

To either take home or expense $50.00 of beer, a month of our own product, or if you live at a location like Saint Louis, where we brew Bush Light and Budweiser and Bud Light and Mick Ultra, you can take some of that home or at Goose Island you can actually go and take home. Small batch innovations up to four cases of it, and it's all expensed as part of our salary essentially. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. See, now I know this because we had a free. And it was one of Frank Siller's high school classmates. And then it's President said. But anyway, he he lived in New York at the same time we did? Yeah. And no matter where we were in the city, he could always pop into a little convenience store and buys buy us some bud light because he had $50.00 a month. 

Speaker 1 

Former and former president sadder. 

Speaker 2 

Part of you know, part of. 

Speaker 1 

But but I think it it, but with New York prices that. 

Speaker 2 

It's compacted, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Doesn't go that far. 

Speaker 15 

I I was going to say it is, it is definitely like a game about it. Depending on where you live, like what is the best. Way to do it. New York does not have the best setup there, but it's. 

Speaker 2 

No. In a pinch. 

Speaker 1 

Not going to ask. I'm going to go there, guys. I'm going to go there. 

Speaker 7 

Where are you? 

Speaker 1 

Is Anheuser Busch looking for sponsorship of a podcast? Because we would love, I'm throwing it. 

Speaker 15 

Out. That's not my check. We did increase our podcast sponsorship budget pretty significantly this. 

Speaker 9 

Why? 

Speaker 7 

Wow. So we're. 

Speaker 15 

Year. 

Speaker 1 

Throwing ourselves out there, I mean, like, look if I. Need to show a little leg. 

Speaker 3 

I'm not too proud. Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Here's something. Here's something very. See, you were also very focused on less alcoholic, non alcoholic drinks for the market, given that younger people are drinking less. And I remember you gave me a recipe for a thing called to patch it, which is. Mexican alcoholic drink, very low and my mom was very excited. My mom from, you know, Mexican heritage, very excited. So we came home COVID year of 2021 or 2020 and it was Christmas time. We got a pineapple. We got some sticks of of cinnamon. Put some sugar in there, filled it with water, put it in a big glass carboy for a couple of days and the sugar and the yeast on the pineapple skin interacted and created fermentation and we had this really. Neat cinnamon pineapple alcohol driven with so low alcoholic you would taste it, but feel it. And it was so good. It was so easy. I was drinking hooch and my mom liked it even more because it. 

Speaker 9 

Was Mexican, no tepache. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 15 

Also thank you for remembering that I forgot that we have shared Apache together we. When you were when you were in Chicago a couple of years ago, we actually found a place that served to populate randomly. Yeah, did that, but yes. 

Speaker 1 

I potty pals. 

Speaker 15 

Yes, agreed. Yeah. So I homebrewed tepache for a couple of years and worked on a project piloting A tepache like seltzer. I guess you could say, but yeah, Apache it's almost like a. Pineapple spiced kombucha. A lot of good drinks in the like lightly fermented category that, like technically, are alcoholic. But you know they're less than 1%. Naturally, you really have to like, try hard to bump it up even like 3% and I've. 

Speaker 3 

All of them. 

Speaker 15 

Done it and it's difficult and you really have to. 

Speaker 1 

Really want to make the. 

Speaker 15 

Boys work to get that much alcohol. 

Speaker 1 

Out of. Yeah, yeah. Don't just say say no. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, don't. Don't do it. Yeah. 

Speaker 9 

We're talking about that. 

Speaker 1 

So anyway, well you. Know now it makes me want to, you know, in this podcast. 

Speaker 3 

Oh. 

Speaker 15 

I have all the equipment and materials at home, so maybe next episode we come back in a in a week or so. 

Speaker 6 

Yeah. Well, let me tell you, I'll take the pineapples I got. 

Speaker 15 

It's. 

Speaker 1 

A connection with pineapple, the pineapple. 

Speaker 6 

Express, you know, that's a lot of stuff. 

Speaker 3 

Ah. 

Speaker 1 

So so anyways, well, right there. Just so much for coming in. We gotta we gotta, we gotta we gotta move on here. There's some more people coming in the way, but please move on the couch. Move on down. We don't have any pot chain, but we'll find you something. But thank you so very much for coming. Thank you for sharing all your little.

You in Chicago. I'm happy to be here. You know what The funny thing is? Like you haven't. You should say, what are you guys's secrets? What are you doing? Are you sleeping like in some hyperbaric chamber or? 

Speaker 2 

Can I posit a guess? What's the? What's Chicago? I mean, these guys are getting off at work at 435 now, 6:00.

A good night. Yeah. Yeah. So you. 

Speaker 8 

Never you say Benjamin button.

Now couple blocks up on. Michigan Ave. that's fantastic. 

Speaker 4 

Watch. 

Speaker 1 

Well. Thanks for stopping by here. We're here on the 23rd. Floor. We had to. 

Speaker 16 

Put the blinds. 

Speaker 1 

Down you see a great view of the. City, but the sun is. 

Speaker 2 

You're welcome now. 

Speaker 1 

It's hotter than Haiti is in here. OK, we'll put, he'll operate them and and probably break them, but now? But I think there's an interesting story. You know, Bobby, our co-host. 

Speaker 17 

From a long ways back. Yeah. At the ND career fair, circa 2015, maybe 2016 around there. Just wanted to talk to him at the EY. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. Wow. Because he didn't help out. Stays there. 142. It's Bobby and one thing you had to do was to. Help out stands. And you didn't hire? You didn't. Oh, my God. 

Speaker 10 

All right. 

Speaker 2 

But it was memorable enough that you remembered it, you know. Yeah, you know, jeez, how's your freshman year? You. 

Speaker 17 

Said it might have been sophomore, give or take, can't remember. It was one of those spring career fairs was for internships or God. 

Speaker 3 

Softened. 

Speaker 2 

Gotcha. Yeah. Well, so I used to, I started working KPMG in 2014 and I would always come back at least once and well often like twice a year for recruiting events. So it makes sense. No, that's great. 

Speaker 17

Great. 

Speaker 1 

It helps for another. You know, it's always you know, what's? Good for the goose is good for the good. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

So anyway, so now. You, if I'm correctly, you're getting married. 

Speaker 17 

Coming up seven months from today. 

Speaker 1 

Tell us about that. Well, oh, my gosh, who's counting? Tell us about that. Tell us about tell. Tell the. Young lady who was marrying into the states family very much like marrying into the Kennedys. Yeah, you know, marrying. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. 

Speaker 10 

Is better outcomes. 

Speaker 17 

Yeah, yeah. Getting married in October to. A at BP Green Phillips Hall Girl and Carrie McAuliffe. So she went to 338 dances. Wow, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Wow, that's interesting. If there's, I mean, I'm sure there's got to be, you know, it's probably a rare club that's. Made all for you. 

Speaker 11 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

It is it is. It is next level. 

Speaker 13 

When we start to figure out. You know. 

Speaker 2 

But all but three items that's that's. Yeah, that's that's significant. Yeah, see better sophomore year then or what? 

Speaker 17 

Sophomore year at the teachers and creatures SYR, and the whatever the room above S dining hall is. That was where it was. The old yeah, that's where we. 

Speaker 3 

Tease me. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Yeah, that's hilarious. And that was the same. 

Speaker 17 

Met. Yeah, yes, yes. And it's oh. Would be would. Be fitting but but now back in. She's from Maryland outside DC. Rockville, from Silver Spring. Getting married, Rockville. 

Speaker 1 

We've been having. A bit of a debate here about the differences between Chicago. And New York. 

Speaker 3 

Well. 

Speaker 17 

We're in New York from Long Island, so. 

Speaker 1 

Is that New York? 

Speaker 11 

Bobby's from New York, from North Jersey. 

Speaker 1 

All right. So tell us you know what? 

Speaker 6 

One of the the. 

Speaker 1 

Pluses and minuses of the two here. 

Speaker 17 

Everyone I know from the East Coast says Chicago is bigger, cleaner and cheaper, and everyone from the Midwest says Chicago is cramped, expensive and dirty. But I love it. I think it's beautiful and big and you know, cheap. Nice. 

Speaker 15 

So. So it's all a matter of perspective. Yeah, yeah, I would. I would agree. Sort of. On the other side of this, you know, to throw the other big metropolis of the US in here, Saint Louis, it is. It is very expensive and cramped when you compare it to other circumstances. So. 

Speaker 8 

Oh, wait, no, wait. 

Speaker 1 

Wait, you you threw it to Saint Louis? But I thought you going to throw in Dallas. You're from the Dallas area? 

Speaker 15 

No, that that is true on a on a more serious note, I actually am from Dallas. Yeah, definitely different. Definitely the actually a more extreme difference between the the other two. So the one. 

Speaker 1 

OK. Well, what do you miss about new? York, the rats. Rats. 

Speaker 16 

Black and white cookies. 

Speaker 17 

I do love like my cookies, pizza bagels, just being a lot closer to everything, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

I didn't change. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Being in the center of the universe. 

Speaker 17 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Boy, Bobby. 

Speaker 2 

Wow. Wow. It's not ethnocentric, but it's true. 

Speaker 17 

Eastern Standard Time is it. 

Speaker 6 

Well, we all know that. 

Speaker 1 

Mr. you, Mr. I'm not joking. This is true outside Youngstown. OH, they have a sign that says the center of the universe. One mile. 

Speaker 16 

Taking a picture. 

Speaker 1 

What I saw, of course I have not. 

Speaker 5 

Been back to Youngstown since that time. 

Speaker 1 

But I would love to take that picture the. Center of the universe. There's nothing. Oh, my gosh. Look who walked right in. It's Tim Sherman. Tim Sherman. Everyone, come on now. Tim. Come on. Take a seat here. Thanks so much for coming, my gosh. 

Speaker 14 

Thanks for having. 

Speaker 1 

Me. So now you're here in Chicago. How long have you? 

Speaker 14 

Been here in Chicago 2 1/2 years. We moved in the. Middle of pandemic. 

Speaker 1 

How was that? 

Speaker 14 

Fine, I I ended up moving in with a couple of other Notre Dame kids, so I had some now these guys, some other Notre Dame friends, so it was nice to have some built-in friends when we weren't allowed to see anybody else. 

Speaker 1 

Oh, not these guys. Not these houses. 

Speaker 14 

Had some some respite from my lonely working days from home. 

Speaker 1 

It was it really locked down, locked down. 

Speaker 16 

Here in Chicago. 

Speaker 14 

I mean not. Bars and stuff were kind of locked down, yeah. 

Speaker 9 

Yeah. 

Speaker 14 

Like I think. We still saw. Each other like a little bit but. 

Speaker 15 

I ran away to Missouri. Yeah, in Saint Louis. Down the river. Yes, yes. 

Speaker 16 

You went down the. 

Speaker 15 

River. 

Speaker 13 

Yeah, I went to the center of the universe. 

Speaker 14 

I was there for a little bit, correct. 

Speaker 1 

Well, here's some we'll get some America's playground here from Toledo to remember Sylvania. Yeah, America's playground. Northwest Ohio. Folks, when you want to go play, go to Toledo. 

Speaker 14 

That's correct. We got all the minor league sports you can. Imagine. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. So now let me ask you, what are you up to? 

Speaker 

These days. 

Speaker 4 

Work. 

Speaker 14 

Working working away, away. Seems like this whole year is just full of weddings and other fun stuff like that, so got a. Bunch of trips up for that. 

Speaker 1 

OK, OK. Let me ask about that. How many toasters can you both? 

Speaker 14 

I don't know. I kind of laugh when I just look at people, wedding registries and then like, I think they appreciate cash more than some napkin holder or something like that that I that I can get them. 

Speaker 1 

Well, what's the weirdest thing? What's the weirdest thing you've seen on a wedding registry? So while we start with I'm. Going to start with with you. 

Speaker 2 

Tim. 

Speaker 14 

I did see one of my coworkers their wedding red tree. They had like $40 like a little like ring for your napkin to like slide into it like a set of floor and they were like $40 each $40 like it needs four. I was like, you don't need 4 of that. You need zero that. 

Speaker 

Yeah. Hold it up. 

Speaker 1 

Patty, what's the way to say hey? 

Speaker 11 

I I I just today I go to a. 

Speaker 8 

Wedding this weekend? Yeah, I bought a water pic. 

Speaker 11 

It's like the power washer for your mouth. Now get that for sure so you know what's, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

A lot of things, yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 15 

Yeah, it seems more utilitarian. 

Speaker 8 

I was really curious. Buy it did. They need water. 

Speaker 11 

Did they need too really going to share this? You know, power washer for. 

Speaker 7 

Yeah, that's true. 

Speaker 11 

Your mouth, I don't. Know I only bought one, yeah. 

Speaker 15 

Maybe that is the Magic 1 already. 

Speaker 11 

No, no. Stress. 

Speaker 15 

I'll say my favorite one was someone very close to me, wanted an entire corn serving set with the little corn hookers, holders and the dishes to match and the whole set adding up to one like it to serve eight people like. 

Speaker 6 

The cone holders. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. 

Speaker 15 

Heat setting. So it was like a $200.00 gift. We ended up having to pivot because we weren't initially like budgeting for as much as the corn set would. Plus, it was someone very close to me who, so it was like kind of a. Weird thing to. Be like, well, if you're listening. 

Speaker 2 

Well. 

Speaker 14 

Good luck to you. Still play force. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a great question. I mean, nothing. Yeah, popping, I mean. 

Speaker 3 

Uh. 

Speaker 2 

It's all pretty. It can all be pretty bizarre. I mean, I think with things like the corn serving set. It's it's someone just mindlessly looking at the bed bath and beyond website and thinking, oh, that'd be nice to have. You're never going. To use it, you're never. 

Speaker 9 

We make sure corn. 

Speaker 1 

Well, in the in the Midwest, the Great Plains. 

Speaker 2 

Going to use it. 

Speaker 16 

We do serve corn. 

Speaker 1 

Bobby, I love that East Coast. You know, elitism again rears its head. Sorry folks. 

Speaker 3 

Well, that's clear. 

Speaker 15 

Yeah, Even so, I'd say the water pick is probably gonna be, yeah, more used. I'll. I'll even pick that. 

Speaker 9 

Is. After the. 

Speaker 11 

You know, it's nice, but it's just not. 

Speaker 17 

I'm sitting this one out as someone who's planning. 

Speaker 1 

Well, she's the one that won the corner. Don't worry, I'll buy you. 

Speaker 2 

Know what's what's. What's common currency these days? Are you knowing straight cash? Cash, yeah. 

Speaker 14 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, but I mean, so we were just talking about. Wedding. I was at this fall. Where? One of the people working and I hate to say, is one of people working in the venue stole my. 

Speaker 3 

What? 

Speaker 11 

Wow. 

Speaker 2 

And you never know with all those envelopes floating around, you know, it's easy for those to go missing. Yeah. So sure. Cash is are. Yeah. Well, so, I mean most. I mean, I would always write checks, but recently I've had a couple of friends who have asked for vendors so they don't have to worry about the checks. Which is. Yeah, it feels a little bit. 

Speaker 11 

They probably do. All right, I'll write checks now. 

Speaker 14 

It feels a little too invisible. Yeah, that's. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, exactly. Well, free transactional book by. 

Speaker 15 

I think a best practice. Yeah. Yeah. I think a a best practice that I've seen is people who. 

Speaker 14 

By buying a ticket for the wedding. 

Speaker 15 

Sort of turned their honeymoon into a narrative, and it's like you can pay for the flight or you can pay for our spot day or something. And that feels more interactive, not as transactional of a way to, you know, help out that way instead of corn. 

Speaker 8 

Yeah. 

Speaker 14 

Even though it's still cash. 

Speaker 7 

Just wait. Just. 

Speaker 14 

It's like I bought like my girlfriend. I bought her friends like they're Hang Gliding trip or something like that. It's like we know. 

Speaker 7 

We bought like. 

Speaker 1 

Hmm. Yeah, that's I saw that. And I was, wow. You know what? I guess I'm I'm a child of the 80s and this is just a little too much. You get a gift and you get a traditional thing and and now it's experiences and this and that. And I don't do we did you did. We give you experiences. Patty, did you ask for experiences? 

Speaker 8 

No, no, no, no. 

Speaker 1 

I think you already. 

Speaker 11 

Came all. I got some silverware. 

Speaker 1 

Well, ladies and gentlemen, we actually didn't think it was possible, but we have even more people who are coming into the podcast. None other than Johnny, Q and Walker. Ugly welcome welcome, welcome. Guys, don't worry. Don't worry. You're. All my friends don't. Worry we can all we all sit the couch together. We can all talk. Don't worry. You can talk, guys. Thanks for. Coming in now queue you just. Flew in here, didn't you? I did. 

Speaker 12 

And you could probably see from my nose little bit of sun. Berry was in Breckenridge. 

Speaker 15 

Ohh wow. 

Speaker 1 

Wow, OK, I guess I don't know if you're looking for some sympathy there, but you're not getting if you are. Wow, lucky you flying these days. This isn't fun. I always try to avoid O'Hare, don't you? I I have to go through O'Hare, unfortunately, but I avoid if I could. And the worst part about O'Hare is it doesn't. It's not a delta. That's right. It's nice. Yeah, I want. I want a sponsorship with and Isaac Bush all, but also not only Anheuser Busch, but also delta. 

Speaker 12 

Best airlines so. 

Speaker 9 

Elton. 

Speaker 12 

Yeah, that's is the best I I say between United and American, I'm loyal to united though. So I think that's the best option if you're in Chicago. 

Speaker 8 

So are you willing to to unite or are you staying between? 

Speaker 11 

Two, because that was our house, OK? 

Speaker 1 

I think torn between two airlines. 

Speaker 12 

Delta is the best, but I never. 

Speaker 7 

They're like a fool. 

Speaker 12 

Fly Delta because there's not many options out of Chicago, so I'm reluctantly loyal to United. 

Speaker 

Oh. 

Speaker 1 

So so remind me these days you base yourself out of Chicago? 

Speaker 12 

Yes. Yeah, based on here and then. I was actually I was in Edmonton in the previous week, miserably cold, but I kind of our have some clients all over the US so kind of traveling to. 

Speaker 3 

Or. 

Speaker 9 

That's Canada, that's Canada. I want you to guess, Canada. 

Speaker 12 

You know our clients. Are appreciate when I forget that. 

Speaker 1 

So anyway, so how long are you in town here? For Q. 

Speaker 12 

I'll be I'll be in town for a couple of weeks now. Hopefully I'll. I don't have to do any traveling. Travel. No more travel so I can enjoy the beautiful spring weather in Chicago. 

Speaker 1 

No more traveling, OK? 

Speaker 14 

No more skiing. 

Speaker 1 

No more skating now, let me ask, is someone who's traveling a lot? What are some of the difficulties in trying to travel these? 

Speaker 16 

I mean, there's, like inconveniences, like, you know, you get this real ID and you got people trying to go in the TSA pre-check line and they're not pre-check. 

Speaker 14 

They make a. 

Speaker 16 

Stink. And they gotta get them out of the way. And everyone's gonna. 

Speaker 12 

Move and you got there. There's a way around, you know, any kind of any kind of line, you know, you just gotta you don't like the pre-check line. You just gotta pay. Pay more and to get the. 

Speaker 

What is? 

Speaker 17 

Here. 

Speaker 12 

But you lose. You lose money. Trying to jump through all the lines so. 

Speaker 1 

I see a little a little money up front goes a. Long way, little density. 

Speaker 12 

Exactly. Yes. Well, the well well policed investment, yeah, if you're looking to go sell South Bend added some direct flights to Orlando here and there. Sometimes it's not every day, but there are occasionally direct flights to Orlando. You I got you. 

Speaker 3 

Games. 

Speaker 2 

I don't need to go to Orlando. 

Speaker 15 

To talk about. 

Speaker 1 

What's what's wrong with the Orlando airport? 

Speaker 7 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

What's wrong the airport about? 

Speaker 2 

Me. Oh, I hate the layout. I hate the little tube trains. You gotta take. Is it the families that I mean, I love families, but it's. 

Speaker 8 

They're in blue Trader town. 

Speaker 2 

Just. Yeah, it's. 

Speaker 9 

That's that. 

Speaker 1 

No, no. Let's unpack that one. Something here do. 

Speaker 11 

You have an experience down there. 

Speaker 2 

No, I've just flown them out there a lot, yes. 

Speaker 9 

I see. Yeah, no. 

Speaker 2 

It's not my favorite. 

Speaker 7 

Yeah, last time I flew out of Orlando, I made it from the Uber onto the plane at 20 minutes without recheck. And it's packed because we got stuff on. The Pirates of the Caribbean ride in the Disney World for an hour and a half. We're sitting on. 

Speaker 9 

Like the boat, what happened it? 

Speaker 7 

Broke and really it's in the in the river, just like looking at these skeletons right next to us there. And then, yeah, we we like we were on there for a good two hours before. 

Speaker 11 

Oh my gosh. 

Speaker 15 

Where to walk off of? 

Speaker 7 

Like through a tunnel and everything. So one right. I got to go on. 

Speaker 1 

Oh my God. Oh my God. Did they offer you? Anything in compensation? 

Speaker 7 

Yeah, they said, come back tomorrow. You get free rides all day. Sorry. 

Speaker 1 

So you can breakdown again. And I go through this traumatic experience. 

Speaker 7 

Yeah. 

Speaker 9 

Again. 

Speaker 1 

Wow, that's amazing. I've never been on a ride. I broke down. I never go on rides. 

Speaker 7 

No. 

Speaker 1 

Because I'm always afraid. Of whiplash, I do want to ask you water. 

Speaker 16 

Did you go? To the turning of the river Green. 

Speaker 7 

I did. I popped in there. I don't need to see the whole process, but I went. 

Speaker 10 

Now how did? 

Speaker 16 

They do. Did they just, like, dump, like a barrel of green food color over a? 

Speaker 7 

They have bullets that go up and down and they. Just attach hoses on. Back and spray fertilizer in there or whatever it is. 

Speaker 1 

It out. 

Speaker 7 

Yeah, local local. 

Speaker 12 

Factories just punch right up to the the green is dumped. Whatever waste they have right into. 

Speaker 1 

The red direction discharging. 

Speaker 7 

Right into the river, they're discharging glory. Enacted that one. 

Speaker 1 

So so now if you got sprayed with that green, would you be dyed green? 

Speaker 16 

Would you get? 

Speaker 7 

That's a good question. I don't want to find it out. 

Speaker 14 

Surprisingly, it's orange. It's it's a powder that's orange when it reacts with the water, it turns green. Yes. So it's a dry powder. So some of. 

Speaker 11 

Orange. Well, that's that's disgusting. 

Speaker 7 

OK, right. 

Speaker 14 

Boats dump it off the back just as powder. Some of the boats have hoses, and so they're swirling the water around and then spraying out like green water into the water. This makes sense. And then after they after they dump in all the like the dye, then more boats come around and just do like 360 turns and just turn the water around. 

Speaker 7 

But. 

Speaker 14 

And I was there for. 

Speaker 11 

Scott, help. 

Speaker 2 

Two years. This is good because at the start of the show. We were talking. About dying the river green and I looked up how much time it takes and it offered a weight measurement. It offered 100 lbs and I said I don't understand why it's not a volume measurement, but this is. What it's a problem? 

Speaker 14 

Dry powder. Yeah. And I've got to be more than that one. 

Speaker 

Something. 

Speaker 15 

£100 feels incredibly efficient, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Well, let's get. Let's get in the volume. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. 

Speaker 9 

Really really understand. 

Speaker 7 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, but that was it for our listeners. It's kind of interesting it it rounds out the picture. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. OK. No. Is. If it does it. It brings us right. Back to where we were beginning. So the brand includes you indeed now, now Tim, were you? 

Speaker 2 

Grand enthusiast. 

Speaker 9 

There I was. He was there. 

Speaker 17 

It's there. 

Speaker 1

Speaker 14 

Not sure I wasn't. They do have some. I think they have like. Parade Queens for like the Saint Patrick's Day parade, and like a a court. So they're on some. Of the boats. But who actually does this? The Queens. And then like their? 

Speaker 

The queen. 

Speaker 14
